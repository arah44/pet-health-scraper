Cats of any age, sex or breed can get Addison‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs more likely in middle-aged cats.\n\nAddison‚Äôs, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, happens when your cat‚Äôs adrenal glands are damaged and don‚Äôt produce enough steroid hormone. Steroid hormones play essential roles in all animals‚Äô bodies. In the early stages of Addison‚Äôs disease, the condition is very hard to recognise because the symptoms are vague, intermittent and can be mistaken for other illnesses. Addison‚Äôs can‚Äôt be cured, but it can be treated successfully for life. Unfortunately, if the condition isn‚Äôt identified and effectively controlled, it can lead to an emergency called an ‚ÄòAddisonian crisis‚Äô, and even death.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Addison‚Äôs disease in cats?\n\nAddison‚Äôs is a disease of the adrenal glands. These are two small structures in your cat‚Äôs tummy near their kidneys. The adrenal glands produce two steroid hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. Your cat depends on these hormones for many essential functions in their body. The symptoms of Addison‚Äôs develop when levels of these hormones in your cat‚Äôs bloodstream fall to abnormally low levels.\n\nHow does Addison‚Äôs disease develop?\n\n‚¶Å Your cat‚Äôs adrenal glands get damaged\n\n‚¶Å Cortisol and aldosterone levels fall to dangerously low levels\n\n‚¶Å Many of your cat‚Äôs cells and body systems stop working properly\n\n‚¶Å Vague signs of illness develop\n\n‚¶Å Vital organs such as heart and kidneys may fail if the condition is not recognised and treated\n\nThe adrenal glands can be damaged by the body‚Äôs own defence cells. Sometimes the body stops recognising its own tissues and attacks them. This is called an autoimmune disease and it‚Äôs the most common cause of Addison‚Äôs disease in cats. We don‚Äôt know for certain why this happens. It may be caused by a faulty gene.\n\nAnatomical location of the pituitary gland and the adrenal glands in cats.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of Addison‚Äôs disease in cats\n\nSymptoms of Addison‚Äôs in cats are vague in the early stages. They may happen on and off over many months.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nPoor appetite\nVomiting\nWeakness and low energy (lethargy)\nWeight loss\nDrinking more and urinating (peeing) more\n‚ÄúJust not right‚Äù\n\nThe main symptom of an Addisonian crisis is collapse.\n\nOther symptoms of an Addisonian crisis include:\n\nWeakness\nAbdominal pain\nPale gums\nSlow heartbeat and breathing\nCold feet and ears\nLoss of consciousness\n\nIf your cat has collapsed, call your nearest vet practice as soon as possible.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of Addison‚Äôs than others?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease in cats is extremely rare. Only around 50 cases have been officially recorded since it was first documented in cats in 1983.\n\nCats of any age, sex or breed can get Addison‚Äôs Disease. It‚Äôs most likely to happen in middle age.\n\nAddison‚Äôs Disease is not dangerous to human family members or to other pets in the house.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose Addison‚Äôs disease in cats?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the symptoms come and go and can be confused with much more common illnesses.\n\nVets diagnose Addison‚Äôs disease through:\n\nsymptoms\nurine tests\nblood tests\ngeneral blood tests: checking liver, kidneys, electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and inflammation\nspecific blood tests:¬† to check your cat‚Äôs steroid hormone production\nan ECG to check your cat‚Äôs heart\nan ultrasound scan of your cat‚Äôs tummy to examine the adrenal glands in more detail\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is often only identified when your cat is admitted to a vet practice or hospital because of severe dehydration or collapse.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for Addison‚Äôs disease in cats\n\nThere‚Äôs no cure for Addison‚Äôs disease.\n\nOnce your cat has been diagnosed, they will need treatment for the rest of their lives.\n\nEmergency treatment for acute (sudden) Addison‚Äôs disease\nFluids given directly into your cat‚Äôs veins for rehydration\nCorrection of sodium and potassium levels in the bloodstream\nEmergency steroid injections to replace essential cortisol\nLongterm treatment for Addison‚Äôs disease\nmonthly injections to replace the hormone aldosterone\ndaily tablets to replace the hormone cortisol (see footnote)\n\nCortisol is a hormone that helps your cat‚Äôs body deal with stress. Without this hormone, anything that stresses your cat may trigger more severe symptoms. This can be overcome by increasing your cat‚Äôs daily dose of steroid tablets during stressful events, such as family gatherings, holidays or if they get another illness.\n\nOnce stabilised on treatment, your cat will continue to need regular checkups with a vet, including blood tests once or twice a year.\n\nThe good news is that most cats respond well to treatment and go on to live full and happy lives.\n\nSadly, some cats respond poorly to treatment, particularly those who have other illnesses at the same time as Addison‚Äôs disease. For cats whose Addison‚Äôs disease cannot be safely and effectively controlled, it may be kinder to end their lives peacefully through euthanasia.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with Addison‚Äôs disease at home\n\nAddison‚Äôs Disease in cats is a serious and complicated disease.\n\nThere are no home remedies to treat Addison‚Äôs disease.\n\nIf your cat has Addison‚Äôs disease, they must have.\n\n¬†prescription medicine from a vet.\n¬†regular check-ups at a vet practice.\n\nFollowing your vet‚Äôs advice will help to ensure your pet can continue their recovery in familiar surroundings at home and reduce the likelihood of expensive vet bills for hospital stays.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat who has Addison‚Äôs disease\n\nAddison‚Äôs cats can‚Äôt produce their own cortisol to cope with stress. So even cats on treatment can become unwell if they experience a new or stressful situation. This includes:\n\ntrips to the vets\ngoing on holiday or into kennels\nvisitors in the house\n\nBut stressful events can also include things which are maybe not as obvious. For example:\n\nchanges in diet\nchanges in routines, including household movements and numbers.\nloss of familiar toys\nother illnesses\n\nSome of these potential stressors can be controlled or avoided altogether by:\n\nkeeping to a suitable diet\nbeing consistent with times for meals and bed\navoiding swapping out favourite toys (and keeping a supply of identical ones, just in case)\nKeeping a close eye on your cat‚Äôs health and responding promptly to any changes\n\nOften, the most stressful things can‚Äôt be prevented or even predicted. This may be unexpected travel or your cat becoming unwell for another reason. In those cases, your cat may need a slightly bigger dose of their daily steroid tablet.\n\nFor your cat‚Äôs safety, any changes to their regular medication should only be carried out under the supervision and guidance of a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nCan Addison‚Äôs in cats be prevented?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is a rare condition. There‚Äôs no way to prevent your cat from developing Addison‚Äôs disease. However, cats experiencing any of the symptoms listed in this article are far more likely to have something more common, which can be readily treated by owners at home or by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent an Addisonian crisis in cats\n\nIf your cat has been diagnosed with Addison‚Äôs disease, the priority is to prevent an Addisonian crisis.\n\nReduce the risk of an Addisonian crisis by:\n\nminimising stress and change in your cat‚Äôs lifestyle, surroundings and routines\ngiving them their medication at the correct dose and at the right time every day\nseeing a vet regularly for checkups and advice on medication\nensuring your cat has regular preventive care, such as vaccinations, worming and flea treatments\ncontacting a vet as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your cat‚Äôs habits or behaviour\n\nWhen should you be worried about Addison‚Äôs disease?\n\nIf Addison‚Äôs is not effectively controlled, your cat is at risk of a life-threatening Addisonian crisis.\n\nSeek help from your nearest vet practice if your cat is showing the following symptoms:\n\nweakness\ncollapse\nabdominal pain\npale gums\nslow heartbeat\nslow breathing\ncold feet and ears\nloss of consciousness\n\nCall your nearest vet immediately if you think your cat is having an Addisonian crisis\n\nCall us and speak to one of our Joii Vets if:\n\nyou are worried your cat may have Addison‚Äôs disease\nyou are worried about an upcoming change or event that may stress your Addison‚Äôs cat.\nyou want to know more about recognising health signs in your cat\nfor peace of mind and professional advice\nchoosing and sticking to the right food for your cat\nsuccessfully managing the routines in your cat‚Äôs life\nadvising on holidays and alternative care for cats\npreparing your cat for trips to the vets\nGiving medication to your cat\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Once your dog has been diagnosed, they‚Äôll need treatment for the rest of their lives.\n\nEmergency treatment for acute (sudden) Addison‚Äôs disease includes:\n\nGiving fluids directly into your dog‚Äôs veins to treat dehydration\nCorrecting sodium and potassium (salt) levels in the blood. This is essential for nerve, heart and muscle function\nGiving emergency steroid injections to replace essential cortisol\n\nThe good news is that most dogs respond well to treatment and go on to live full and happy lives.\n\nSome dogs who have other illnesses at the same time as Addison‚Äôs disease respond poorly to treatment.\n\nIf their Addison‚Äôs disease can‚Äôt be controlled, your dog‚Äôs quality of life will be poor and outlook more uncertain.\n\n¬†\n\nAre there any home remedies for Addison‚Äôs disease in dogs?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease can‚Äôt be treated with home remedies.\n\nIt‚Äôs a serious and complicated disease. If your dog has Addison‚Äôs disease, they need prescription medicine from a vet and regular check-ups at a vet clinic.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to live with a dog who has Addison‚Äôs disease\n\nDogs with Addison‚Äôs disease can‚Äôt produce enough cortisol. Cortisol is known as ‚Äòthe stress hormone‚Äô as it helps the body cope with stress. Healthy dogs can produce more cortisol whenever it‚Äôs needed. Dogs with Addison‚Äôs disease depend on their daily cortisol medicine. Their body can‚Äôt produce more to cope with sudden stressful events.\n\nStressful events may include:\n\nVisiting the vet clinic\nGoing on holiday\nGoing into kennels\nHaving visitors in the house\n\nStressful events can also include less ‚Äòobvious‚Äô things, such as:\n\nChanges in diet\nChanges in routines, such as the times and places for walks\nLosing familiar toys\nHaving another illness\n\nSo some of these potential stressors can be controlled or avoided altogether, for example by:\n\nKeeping to a suitable diet\nBeing consistent with times for walks, meals and bed\nAvoiding swapping out favourite toys (and keeping a supply of identical ones, just in case‚Ä¶)\nKeeping a close eye on your dog‚Äôs health and responding promptly to any changes\n\nThe most stressful events can‚Äôt always be predicted or prevented.

Cats rarely experience limping, as seen in dogs. Instead, they will typically exhibit changes in behaviour, activity levels, and routines. Arthritis in cats has been proven to be very common, especially in those older than 12 years.\n\nArthritis is irreversible and causes progressive deterioration of the joints, leading to pain, inflammation, and stiffness. Arthritis is also called osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease (DJD). There are many different medications for the treatment of arthritis and also other options such as alternative therapies and surgery. The key is to assess and adapt treatment plans regularly.\n\nWhat is arthritis in cats?\n\nArthritis simply means ‚Äúinflammation of the joints‚Äù.\n\nThe most common type of arthritis in cats is osteoarthritis. Other types include rheumatoid arthritis and septic arthritis, which is caused by joint infection.\n\nArthritis is a complex condition that affects not only the cartilage but all the structures within the joint. If left unmanaged, it can lead to complete joint failure. Arthritis can affect any joint and may affect multiple joints.\n\nIt is a very common condition in cats and in many cases is associated with significant life-long pain. It is often difficult to detect the signs of arthritis in cats due to the difficulty in recognizing the symptoms.\n\nArthritis can cause a change in lifestyle, behaviour and activity levels (such as reluctance to jump and groom).\n\nIt is a progressive disease, meaning it gets slowly worse over time.\n\nHow does a cat get arthritis?\n\nThere is no single cause of arthritis. Many factors play a role, including:\n\nBody conformation (how a cat is built)\nBeing overweight\nAbnormal joint development (e.g. hip dysplasia)\nActivity history\nPrevious injuries\nOrthopaedic surgery\nNutritional history\n\nMost cats with arthritis experience a combination of these factors as their condition develops and progresses. We now know that just ‚Äògetting old‚Äô is not a cause of arthritis.\n\nHow to identify the signs of arthritis in cats\n\nCats are incredible at ‚Äòcoping‚Äô with discomfort. Which makes detecting it difficult.¬†These are possible signs of arthritis and chronic pain in cats:\n\n¬†\n\nMobility changes\nnot jumping up or down\nsize or height of the jump\ngracefulness\nchanges in toileting\n\n¬†\n\nActivity levels\nsleeping more\nplaying and hunting less\n\n¬†\n\nGrooming habits\ndull or matted coat condition\nchange in scratching behaviours\n\n¬†\n\nTemperament\nreduced tolerance to the owner or other animals\nchange in the general attitude\n\nCan any cat develop arthritis?\n\nAny cat can develop arthritis, but those that may be more prone to arthritis are:\n\nCats with known developmental joint problems, commonly seen in breeds such as Maine Coon, Persian, Burmese, Himalayan breeds, Scottish Fold.\n\nOverweight¬†cats.\n\nCats who have¬†had previous surgery on a joint.\n\nAn¬†injured or traumatised¬†joint.\n\nHow is arthritis in cats diagnosed?\n\nTo help determine whether your cat has arthritis, your vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your cat‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\n\nAdditional tests to rule out other conditions might be recommended by your vet:\n\nBlood tests\nUrine test\nChecking thyroid levels\nJoint aspirate and cytology\nOccasionally MRI or a CT scan\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for a cat with arthritis?¬†\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for arthritis, but through careful management, we can give cats comfortable and happy lives.\n\nTreatment options can include one or more of the following:\n\nMedications\nComplementary and alternative therapies\nSurgery\nIntra articular treatments\n\n¬†\n\nMedications for a cat with arthritis\n\nA combination of treatments is recognized as the best way to control pain with minimal side effects and to protect kidneys and liver.\n\nMedication commonly used includes:\n\nAnti-Inflammatory medications\nSolensia\nGabapentin\nAmantadine\nAmitriptyline\nTramadol\n\nDo not use medication for humans as these can be fatal to cats.¬†Seek professional advice from a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies¬†for a cat with arthritis\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies are often used alongside conventional treatment to help control arthritis symptoms. The various options are below.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬†The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nChiropathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP),¬†British Veterinary Chiropractic Association (BVCA)\nOsteopathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), European Veterinary Society for Osteopathy (EVSO)\nLaser therapy\nAcupuncture:¬†Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\nMagnetic field therapy\nMassage\nHomeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\nElectrohydraulic shockwave therapy\n\n¬†\n\nSurgery for a cat with arthritis\n\nThe surgical approach to managing arthritis in cats can be simplified into 3 main categories:\n\nPreventative surgery: aims to delay the onset of arthritis due to abnormal joints or a damaged joint.\n\nStabilising surgery: aims to slow the progression or control the pain of arthritis. A good example is surgery that aims to improve the stability lost in a cranial cruciate ligament rupture (a disease of the knee).\n\nSalvage surgery: aims to improve the dog‚Äôs signs and not to preserve the joint.¬† An example is a total hip replacement or a femoral head excision surgery for hip arthritis.\n\n¬†\n\nIntra-articular treatments for a cat with arthritis\n\nManaging the disease through injections in the joint. The most common intra-articular injection is Stem cells.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still incomplete scientific work to encourage the use of these treatments more commonly.\n\nWhat role do you play in your cat‚Äôs arthritis care?\nHome treatments for cats with arthritis\n\nAs part of your vet‚Äôs treatment plan, it is often advised that you introduce one or more of the following:\n\nHome environment adaptations\nKeep your cat slim\nDiet and nutrition\nSupplements\n\n¬†\n\nHome environment adaptations for a cat with arthritis\n\nFeatures within a home or environment can positively or negatively affect your cat‚Äôs ability to move safely and independently.\n\nYou can improve your cat‚Äôs quality of life with these adaptations:\n\nProvide steps or ramps to ease access to furniture.\nFind a large litter tray with chamfered edges that is easily accessible.\nProvide a comfortable bed.\nPlace the litter boxes, food and dishes, and favourite beds on a single level of the home.\nEncourage mental stimulation. Interact and play with your cat. Provide at least three sessions per day and several minutes for each session. Holding, grooming, or stroking your cat, particularly around the head, releases chemicals that improve their mood and ability to cope with chronic pain.\nPheromone therapy. There is evidence that therapy with pheromones (chemical signals that animals naturally release and detect) can reduce the impact of a stressful environment. There are products available that contain feline facial pheromones. Make sure you get professional advice before you buy something like this.\n\n¬†\n\nWeight management of cats with arthritis\n\nA healthy weight will relieve stress on the joints and is important for minimizing pain. It can also help slow down the progression of the disease.\n\nThe best way to assess your cat is to look at its shape.\n\nGive your cat a ‚Äòbody condition score‚Äô using the body condition score chart.\n\nIt can be very hard for a cat to lose weight. Seek professional advice if you need help.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\n\n¬†\n\nDiet and nutrition for a cat with arthritis\nReaching and maintaining optimal body weight is the most important factor that may influence the choice of diet for your arthritic cat.\nSupplementation during meals¬†can also provide a combination of the two: optimal body weight and joint supplementation.\nMobility and joint support commercial diets¬†tend to provide optimal weight management in addition to including ingredients similar to those found in supplements.\n\n¬†\n\nSupplements for a cat with arthritis\n\nA lot of supplements sold in the companion animal market do not have proven health benefits.\n\nIt is easy to be misled into using them, especially when:\n\nThey are easy to buy ‚Äì online, in shops, at pet stores, and as human equivalents in pharmacies.\nThey are believed to be ‚Äònatural‚Äô, so unable to do harm.\nThe majority do not need a veterinary prescription to buy them.\n\nSeek professional advice from a vet if you need further guidance.\n\n¬†\n\nBelow is a complete list of supplements that may help to ease arthritis symptoms:\n\nAvocado & soybean unsaponifiables (supplement made from a specific part of the oil of avocados and from soybeans) ‚Äì Do not feed avocado fruit to your pet, there is a risk of pancreatitis\nBoswelia (extracted from the bark and resin of the indian boswelia tree)\nCat‚Äôs claw (from an amazonian plant)\nCBD (an active ingredient in cannabis extracted from hemp plant)\nChondroitin sulphate (extracted from mammalian cartilage, normally bovine tracheas)\nCollagen hydrosylates ( also known as gelatin and is made from collagenous structures of mammals such as bovine tendons)\nDevil‚Äôs claw (a plant)\nDPLA (a protein that is believed to have pain and mood elevating effects)\nGlucosamine (a natural compound found in cartilage)\nGreen-lipped mussel extract a bivalve mollusc extract)\nHyaluronic acid (a component of joint fluid that gives it elasticity)\nMethylsulfonylmethane is a chemical that occurs naturally in humans, as well as some green plants and animals)\nOmega-3&6 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids)\nSAMe (a compound found naturally in the body)\nTurmeric & curcumin (turmeric is a plant, whose roots are commonly used to make the spice, while curcumin is the naturally-occurring compound in the plants roots that give it the yellow colour)\nVitamin e\nWillow bark (a herbal preparation containing salicylic acid from which aspirin is derived)\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to expect if your cat has arthritis?\n\nCaring for a cat with arthritis can be stressful.

This makes detecting pain difficult.\n\nThese are possible signs of arthritis and chronic pain in dogs:\n\nBehavioural changes\n\nbeing more grumpy\nplaying with their toys less\nlicking their joints\npacing at night\ndepression\nlow mood\n\nPosture changes:\n\nhunched back\navoiding putting weight through one of their legs when standing\nchanges in body shape due to muscle loss\nlow head carriage\ntucked up tail\ndifferent sleeping positions\nenlarged or swollen joints.\n\nMobility changes:¬†\n\nslowing down on walks\nstiffness when getting up after a period of rest\nhesitating when using stairs\nno longer jumping up onto the sofa\nlameness/limping\ndragging their feet\nweak back legs.\n\n¬†\n\nCheck arthritis symptoms\n\n¬†\n\nCan any dog develop arthritis?\n\nDogs that may be more prone to arthritis are:\n\nMedium to large breed¬†dogs such as Rottweilers, Golden and Labrador Retrievers, and Springer Spaniels\nDogs prone to¬†developmental joint problems¬†such as:\nHip and elbow dysplasia:¬†common in Mastiffs, Boxers, German Shepherds, Golden and Labrador Retrievers\nPatellar luxation (kneecap that ‚Äòpops out‚Äô):¬†commonly seen in Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire terriers and French Bulldogs\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD) (joint condition in which the bone underneath the cartilage of a joint dies due to lack of blood flow)¬†commonly seen in Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Chow Chows, German Shepherds, Mastiffs, Old English Sheepdogs, Rottweilers\nOverweight¬†dogs\nDogs with¬†injured or traumatised¬†joints\nDogs who¬†had previous surgery on a joint¬†(e.g. surgery to treat Cruciate Ligament Disease)\n\n¬†\n\nHow is arthritis diagnosed in dogs?\n\nTo help determine whether your dog has arthritis, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your dog‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake Radiographs (x-rays)\n\nAdditional tests to rule out other conditions may be recommended by your vet:\n\nBlood tests\nUrine test\nChecking thyroid levels\nJoint aspirate and cytology\nOccasionally MRI or a CT scan\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for a dog with arthritis?\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for arthritis, but through careful management, we can give dogs comfortable and happy lives.\n\nTreatment options can include one or ideally a combination of the following:\n\nMedications\nComplementary and alternative therapies\nSurgery\nIntra articular treatments\n\n¬†\n\nMedications for a dog with arthritis\n\nA¬†combination of treatments is recognised as the best way to control pain with minimal side effects and protect the kidneys and liver.\n\nMedication commonly used includes:\n\nAnti-inflammatory medications\nGalliprant\nLibrela\nParacetamol\nCartrophen\nCorticosteroids\nAspirin\nGabapentin and pregabalin\nAmantadine\nAmitriptyline\nCodeine\nOther opioids (tramadol ‚Äì recent evidence suggests this is not as effective in dogs for pain relief when used by itself)\n\nDo not use human medications as these can be extremely harmful and cause fatalities in dogs.¬†Always seek advice from a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies¬†for a dog with arthritis\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies are often used alongside conventional treatment to help control arthritis symptoms. The various options are below.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals\n\nPhysiotherapy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬† The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nHydrotherapy: National Association of Registered Canine Hydrotherapists, Canine Hydrotherapy Association\nLaser therapy\nAcupuncture:¬†Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\nMagnetic field therapy\nChiropathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP),¬†British Veterinary Chiropractic Association (BVCA)\nOsteopathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP),¬†European Veterinary Society for Osteopathy (EVSO)\nMassage\nHomoeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\nElectrohydraulic shockwave therapy\n\n¬†\n\nSurgery for arthritis\n\nThe surgical approach to managing arthritis in dogs can be simplified into three main categories:\n\nPreventative surgery: Aims to delay the onset of arthritis due to abnormal or damaged joints.\n\nStabilising surgery: Aims to slow the progression or control the pain of arthritis.¬†A good example is a surgery that aims to re-establish the stability lost in a cranial cruciate ligament rupture (a disease of the knee).\n\nSalvage surgery: Aims to improve the dog‚Äôs symptoms and not to preserve the joint.¬†An example is a total hip replacement or a femoral head excision surgery for hip arthritis.\n\n¬†\n\nIntra-articular treatments¬†for arthritis\n\nManaging the disease through injections in the joint.\n\nThere are many different intra-articular injection medications and substances:\n\nSteroids\nHyaluronic acid\nPlatelet rich plasma\nStem cells\nHydrogels\n\nUnfortunately, there is still incomplete scientific work to encourage the use of these treatments more commonly.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat role do you play for your dog with arthritis?\nHome treatments for arthritis in dogs\n\nAs part of your vet‚Äôs treatment plan, often it is advised that you introduce one or more of the following:\n\nWeight control\nDiet and nutrition\nSupplements\nHome environment adaptations\nModifying exercise routines\nHeating pads\n\n¬†\n\nWeight control for a dog with arthritis\n\nA healthy weight will relieve stress on the joints and is an important part of minimising pain, as well as slowing down the progression of the disease.\n\nStudies have shown that losing 6% of excess body weight will significantly reduce an arthritic dog‚Äôs lameness.\n\nNote that 63% of all dogs are overweight, and 90% of owners cannot see that their dog is overweight!\n\nThe best way to assess your dog is to look at their body shape. Give your dog a ‚Äúbody condition score‚Äù using the body condition score chart.\n\nIf you need help reducing your dog‚Äôs weight, reach out to a vet nurse.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nDiet and nutrition for a dog with arthritis\nMobility/joint support commercial foods: help with weight management and have the added benefit of including ingredients similar to those found in supplements. This reduces the need for extra costs on supplements and may help reduce the amount of pain medication given.\nReaching and maintaining optimal body weight: when using other foods, consider your dog‚Äôs reduced energy needs.\nSupplements: added to meals can help with optimal body weight and joint support.\n\n¬†\n\nSupplements for a dog with arthritis\n\nThere are many easily available supplements for dogs. Be careful when buying these, always seek veterinary advice first.\n\nBelow is a complete list of supplements that may help to ease arthritis symptoms:\n\nAvocado & soybean unsaponifiables (supplement made from a specific part of the oil of avocados and from soybeans) ‚Äì Do not feed avocado fruit to your pet without consulting a professional, there is a risk of obstruction and pancreatitis\nBoswelia (extracted from the bark and resin of the indian boswelia tree)\nCat‚Äôs claw (from an amazonian plant)\nCBD (an active ingredient in cannabis extrated from hemp plant)\nChondroitin sulphate (extracted from mammalian cartilage, normally cow windpipes)\nCollagen hydrosylates (also known as gelatin, it‚Äôs made from collagenous structures of mammals such as bovine tendons)\nDevil‚Äôs claw (a plant)\nDPLA (a protein that is believed to have pain relief and mood elevating effects)\nGlucosamine (a natural compound found in cartilage)\nGreen lipped mussel extract (a bivalve mollusc extract)\nHyaluronic acid (a component of joint fluid that gives it elasticity)\nMethylsulfonylmethane (a chemical that occurs naturally in humans, as well as some green plants and animals)\nOmega-3&6 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids)\nSAMe (a compound found naturally in the body)\nTurmeric & curcumin (turmeric is a plant, whose roots are commonly used to make the spice, while curcumin is the naturally-occurring compound in the plant‚Äôs roots that give it the yellow colour)\nVitamin E\nWillow bark (a herbal preparation that contains salicylic acid from which aspirin is derived)\n\n¬†\n\nHome environment adaptations for a dog with arthritis\n\nFeatures within the home environment can positively or negatively affect your dog‚Äôs ability to move safely and independently.\n\nThese adaptation options can improve your dog‚Äôs quality of life:\n\nCover slippery floors: Secure mats and rugs to the floor with non-slip tape to stop them from moving and minimise slipping.\nAdapt your stairs: You can do this by using a sling or a harness or by adding ramps.\nFind a suitable bed: Dogs that struggle to step into their beds may find it easier if the edge is sloped. Shorter legs need lower beds.\nFurniture access:\nMake sure any ramp or step has a non-slip surface.\nGive your dog a mat or carpet to stand on for feeding and drinking.\nRaised bowls can sometimes be very helpful.\n\n¬†\n\nModifying exercises routines for your arthritic dog\n\nRegular and controlled walks are very important, as this can also provide a natural pain relief effect if done correctly.\n\nA sudden increase in exercise can make your dog more stiff and painful.\n\n¬†\n\nBut how many minutes and how much time per day should you exercise your dog?\n\nEach dog is different, so keep the walks at a comfortable length and frequency for your pet.\n\nWatch your dog on your walk and observe:\n\nAre they getting slow?\nAre they dragging behind?\nHave they become a bit wobbly?\nAre they beginning to stumble or scuff their feet?\n\nIf you see changes that indicate they are tired or starting to struggle, turn around and head home.\n\n¬†\n\nMake an exercise plan\n\nThis can prevent pain afterwards and will still provide happy walks.¬†Things to think about before going out:\n\nThe landscape. Avoid hard, irregular landscapes and soft sand beaches. Choose flat, short grass instead.\nAvoid tricky obstacles\nAdapt your routine\nStop high-intensity exercises and games (you can still make it fun with more mentally stimulating games instead)\nConserve energy to get home\nTake a break during the walk\n\n¬†\n\nHeat pads for dogs with arthritis\n\nHeat increases blood flow to an area, reducing muscle spasms and providing a soothing sensation.\n\nFor most dogs, applying a heat pack to the stiff areas for 10 minutes before exercise can be helpful. Seek professional advice from a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to expect if your dog has arthritis?\n\n¬†\n\nHow long will a dog with arthritis live?\n\nYour dog‚Äôs arthritis will continue to progress over time.\n\nAlthough there‚Äôs no cure for arthritis, by working closely with your vet, there are lots of ways you can control the symptoms and keep your dog comfortable without shortening their life.\n\n¬†\n\nCost of treating a dog with arthritis\n\nTreatment for arthritis can become expensive.\n\nIt is important that you¬†insure your dog¬†as soon as you get them, before any signs of illness start, so you have all the support you need to look after them.\n\nTry to speak openly to your vet about any treatment cost concerns, along with what you think is right for your dog.\n\nOften, there are multiple treatment options, so if one doesn‚Äôt work for you and your pet, then your vet may be able to offer an alternative.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to put a dog down with arthritis?\n\nWhen making this very emotional and hard decision, there are some tools that can help you find the right moment to say goodbye by looking for consistent deterioration and poor quality of life.\n\nIf you need help coping with grief and loss, you can contact us at Joii.\n\n¬†\n\nCan arthritis in dogs be prevented?\n\nWhen the likely cause of arthritis is early identified, it is possible to prevent and delay the clinical signs of arthritis.\n\nPractical ways to reduce your dog‚Äôs chances of developing arthritis later in life:\n\n¬†\n\nSpeak to a vet or nurse\n\nThey can help with early diagnosis and track any changes.\n\nThis will allow for more treatment options and more time for you to influence the course of the disease.\n\nAs they reach middle and senior age, this becomes increasingly important.\n\n¬†\n\nWeight management\n\nGiving your dog the correct food and quantity for their age and stage of development is vital.\n\n¬†\n\nExercise with caution\n\nStaying fit and exercising regularly will help your dog‚Äôs muscles stay strong and reduce joint stress.\n\nNever exercise to the point of fatigue.\n\nHigh impact, sharp starts or stops, twisting, and repetitive movements such as ball throwing can be too intense for the joints.\n\n¬†\n\nNeutering\n\nIf you plan to neuter your dog, do so with guidance regarding the most appropriate age for their breed.\n\nEarly neutering can increase the risk of arthritis.\n\nDogs with developmental joint diseases leading to severe arthritis should not be used for breeding.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry if your dog has Arthritis?\n\nCall your local vet¬†if your dog shows any of these signs:\n\nContinued or worsening symptoms despite treatment\nSudden and dramatic worsening of stiffness or limping\nLoss of appetite\nVomiting or diarrhoea, especially if taking medications\nIncreased drinking or urination\n\nWaiting until your dog¬†yelps or their legs fail¬†to confirm your suspicions of pain¬†will mean they are in excruciating pain.

About 5% of cats get some sort of urinary tract problem in their lives. But young neutered (castrated) male cats who live indoors are most at risk of a blocked bladder. A blocked bladder is a life-threatening emergency for your cat.\n\nThe bladder is part of the body‚Äôs waste-disposal system.¬† Pee removes harmful waste products from inside your cat‚Äôs body. If your cat can‚Äôt pee, toxic waste builds up inside their body, making them very sick very quickly. The bladder may even burst. A blocked cat won‚Äôt survive more than 4 or 5 days without prompt treatment. Around 10% of cat emergencies and specialist cases are male cats with blocked bladders. The outlook is best when the problem is quickly identified and treated.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat has a blocked bladder:\n\nA blocked bladder is a veterinary emergency!\n\nCall your nearest vet if your cat can‚Äôt pass any pee.\n\nRecognise the warning signs.\n\nSpeak to a vet if your cat is taking longer to pee than normal.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of a blocked bladder in cats\n\nA blocked bladder means pee can‚Äôt pass through the urethra. This is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. Anything which narrows the urethra can cause a blocked bladder.\n\nThis includes:\n\nMucus and debris: cells, fat, waste sludge.\nCrystals or stones formed from chemicals and minerals in the urine.\nInflammation and scarring from previous damage.\nMuscle spasm: the muscles surrounding the urethra contract. Possibly triggered by stress.\nCancer.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen should you be worried about a blocked bladder\n\nA blocked bladder is a veterinary emergency.\n\nCats can die from a blocked bladder.\n\nCall a vet immediately if your cat is showing symptoms of a blocked bladder\n\nA blocked bladder results in toxins building up inside your cat‚Äôs body.

Their snuffly breathing is often considered normal but is actually a sign that they are struggling to breathe.\n\nBOAS stands for brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome but can also be called brachycephalic respiratory syndrome. BOAS refers to a group of conditions caused by abnormalities in the body that can often result in breathing difficulties and other problems. Early diagnosis is extremely important.

These include the nose, mouth, throat and windpipe.\n\nThe physical changes seen in dogs with brachycephalic syndrome are:\n\nNarrowed nostrils\nCompacted nasal cavities and a short nose\nOverlong soft palate (which contributes to ‚Äúsnoring‚Äù noises when they breathe)\nA tongue that is too big for their shortened head\nA narrow trachea\nThroat problems\n\nIt is possible for your pet to suffer from one or more of these problems, which can result in different degrees of obstruction.\n\nNarrow nostrils\nCrowded nose and throat\nOverlong soft palate\nNarrow windpipe\n\n¬†\n\nDue to these features, these dogs ‚Äúpull‚Äù harder when they breathe in. This creates a strong negative pressure in their throats, necks, and chests. And this leads to additional respiratory and digestive problems, like vomiting.\n\nSpeak to a vet about your dog‚Äôs nose shape and discuss any symptoms. Early diagnosis has a big impact on your dog‚Äôs quality of life and life span.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of BOAS in dogs\n\nThe signs of BOAS are varied and can range in severity, including some or all of the following:\n\nDifficulty breathing\nLoud, raspy respiratory sounds\nExcessive panting\nSnorting\nSnoring\nCoughing\nGagging or retching\nDifficulty exercising\nCollapse\nWorsening signs in hot or humid weather\nVomiting and regurgitation\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of BOAS than others?\n\nSevere breathing problems can be life-threatening.\n\nThere are four main risk factors:\n\nBrachycephalic breeds, including English and French Bulldogs, Boxers, Pugs, Shih-Tzus, Pekingese, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Dogue de Bordeaux, and Chow Chow.\nThe severity of the physical defects.\nBeing overweight or obese.\nOlder age.\nDifference between the head shape of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù dog (top) and a brachycephalic breed (bottom).\n\n¬†\n\nHow will your vet know if your dog has BOAS?\n\nYour vet will assess your dog‚Äôs facial shape and behaviour in certain circumstances. They will also carry out a physical examination and perform further investigation:\n\nVisual inspection\nHeavy sedation or full anaesthesia\nRhinoscopy\nX-rays and/or CT scans\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment options available for dogs with brachycephalic syndrome:\n\nThe main treatments include¬†weight control¬†and¬†surgery.\n\nWill your dog need BOAS surgery?\n\nThere is a good chance your flat-face dog has a degree of upper airway obstruction. Snoring noises are usually a sign of upper airway obstruction. The key is to decide if surgical correction will improve their quality of life.\n\nYour veterinarian might recommend one or more of the following¬†surgical procedures¬†based on your dog‚Äôs specific needs. In some cases, referral to a specialist surgeon is recommended.\n\nWidening of the nostrils\nReducing the length of the soft palate\nRemoving excessive and/or everted throat tissue\n\nEven with surgery, brachycephalic animals‚Äô airways will never be completely normal.\n\nAre there any medical treatment options for dogs with BOAS?\nWeight control\nMedication to reduce inflammation\nTreatment of any other related conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, pneumonia, and allergic diseases.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog with BOAS at home?\n\nThere is a lot you can do at home to improve your dog‚Äôs health if they have BOAS, such as:\n\nKeep your dog slim:¬†Most flat-faced dog owners resign themselves to the fact that their dog is overweight. This mostly happens because of the breed‚Äôs tendency to gain weight due to their lifestyle. Being overweight isn‚Äôt normal for flat-faced dogs. Plus carrying extra weight will make any breathing problems worse.\n\nThe best way to assess your dog is to look at their body shape. Give your dog a ‚Äúbody condition score‚Äù using the body condition score chart. Vet nurses can help you to reduce your dog‚Äôs weight.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nKeep them fit:¬†Keep your dog as fit as possible and build their fitness gradually.

Stress and intense exercise commonly cause fast breathing, but if these are not the cause or the breathing isn‚Äôt returning to normal, a serious condition may be present.\n\nMost cats will only breathe with their mouth open if they are very stressed or have a serious problem. Normal breathing movements in cats are very subtle and silent. Any breathing changes lasting more than a few minutes should be discussed with a vet, and this is urgent if the breathing is getting worse or if it is noisy or laboured.\n\nRecording breaths per minute at rest is a useful way to monitor chronic conditions, especially those affecting the heart and lungs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my cat is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and remove anything that may cause stress for your cat. If your cat has been showing other signs of not being well it is advisable to contact a vet. This is urgent if the breathing is getting worse.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of fast breathing in cats\n\nStress and fear\n\nExercise, especially in warm weather\n\nFever\n\nPain\n\nAsthma\n\nAirway infections such as cat flu or pneumonia\n\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes\n\nAnaemia\n\nHeart disease or other causes of pulmonary oedema\n\nInfection or fluid around the lungs, called pleural effusion\n\nForeign bodies in the airways\n\nPulmonary trauma or diaphragmatic hernial, can happen due to road traffic accidents, falls or other trauma)\n\nLungworm or other parasites in the respiratory tract\n\nSevere tummy swelling\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about fast breathing\n\nThe normal breathing rate for cats is around 20-30 breaths per minute at rest. This can increase a lot with exercise or stress but should return to normal in minutes.\n\nTake your cat to an emergency vet straight away if:\n\nGums or tongue look blue, purple or pale\nYou can see something obstructing the airway that cannot be safely removed\nYour cat is breathing with the mouth open, especially if the neck is outstretched and the front limbs are spread apart\nBreathing is noisy, especially if wheezing is present\nThe abdomen is moving noticeably when they breathe\nYour cat is not acting normal\n\n¬†\n\nPrevention tips to avoid fast breathing in cats\n\nNeutering may reduce roaming and help prevent accidents and injuries.\n\nVaccinations will limit the risk of some infections that cause airway disease.\n\nRegular monitoring and treatment may prevent some complications from chronic heart and lung disease.\n\nLungworm is becoming more common all over the UK. It is more common in dogs, but cats can also be affected. Other parasites can be contracted during hunting and roaming. Regular deworming, flea and mite control with good quality products can prevent problems.\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of fast breathing in cats\n\nIf your cat‚Äôs breathing rate is increased, your vet will:\n\nexamine your cat\nlisten to their chest\ncheck their temperature\nrecommend blood tests\ndiscuss x-rays and scans\n\n¬†\n\nHome remedies for fast breathing in cats\n\nThere are no home treatments for fast breathing in cats.\n\nIf your cat has started breathing fast suddenly and is not recovering quickly, please take your cat to see a vet immediately.\n\nTake their respiratory rate while they are asleep.

This can increase dramatically during or after exercise but should return to normal within minutes. If breathing appears difficult or if your dog appears distressed or restless, please seek help straight away. Abnormal noises, stretched-out neck, strong abdominal movements or a change in the colour of your dog‚Äôs gums are other signs that there is a serious problem.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my dog is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and avoid things your dog may find stressful or exciting. Ensure they are in a cool and well-ventilated area, if possible.\n\nIt is always advisable to get a vet to check if your dog‚Äôs breathing has changed. The faster the change, the more urgent the problem is.\n\nIf the weather is very hot and you are concerned about heat stroke, please see further advice here\n\nA gradual increase in breaths per minute while resting may be an early warning sign that conditions like heart disease or bronchitis are getting worse. Counting and recording breaths per minute a few times per week may be very useful as part of the monitoring of these conditions.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of fast breathing in dogs\n\nExercise, hot weather, hot cars or other places with poor air circulation\n\nStress and fear\n\nAnatomical problems with the airways.

It appears as a smooth pink or red swelling in the inside corner of the eye. When cherry eye happens in cats, it‚Äôs most likely in Burmese or Persian cats.\n\nCherry eye often looks worse than it is. The swelling is a tear gland that‚Äôs popped out in the wrong place. Cherry eye isn‚Äôt painful but the swollen gland can get irritated and inflamed if untreated. It may come and go, to begin with, but usually needs surgery. A short operation can return the gland to the right place and secure it there.\n\nWhat is cherry eye in cats?\n\nCats have three eyelids, unlike humans, who have only two. The third eyelid is hidden in the corner of the eye. It‚Äôs almost invisible when your cat‚Äôs eye is open. When your cat blinks, the third eyelid moves over the eye and spreads tears across it. This helps keep the clear part of the eye (the cornea) moist, and helps to remove dust and other small irritants.The third eyelid also has a gland that produces tears.\n\nBut the attachment of the gland to the third eyelid is very loose. Cherry eye happens when the third eyelid tear gland pops out from the underside of the third eyelid.\n\nThe misplaced (prolapsed) gland appears as a pink swelling\nThe cherry eye may come and go at first, but usually needs treatment eventually\nOver time, the exposed gland gets swollen and irritated\nRubbing causes more irritation and damage\nInfection becomes a risk\nThe eye may become dry if the gland can‚Äôt produce tears any more.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of cherry eye in cats\n\nCherry eye is easy to spot when it happens.You can see the prolapsed gland as a lump. It can look like a small cherry in the corner of the eye. That‚Äôs how it gets its name.\n\nCherry eye appears suddenly as a red lump in the corner of one or both eyes\nIt may not bother your cat at first\nOver a few days your cat starts to paw or rub at the eye\nInflammation and infection make the swelling redder and bigger\nGreenish or yellow discharge happens when infection develops\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of getting cherry eye?\n\nCherry eye is uncommon in cats. It‚Äôs most likely to happen in shorter-faced breeds with ‚Äòlarger‚Äô, more protruding eyes. This includes Burmese and Persian cats.\n\nAre my family or other pets at risk of cherry eye?\nCherry eye isn‚Äôt infectious. It won‚Äôt spread between animals or from animals to humans\nOther pets belonging to a susceptible breed may also get cherry eye\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose cherry eye in cats?\n\nVets can diagnose cherry eye by its distinctive appearance.\n\nThey may also carry out some additional tests to check for:\n\nDry eye: resulting from damage to the prolapsed tear gland.\n\nThe Schirmer tear test is a simple test to check tear production: placing a special indicator paper on the eye surface.\n\nScratches or ulcers on the cornea (the clear ‚Äòwindow‚Äô surface of the eye): resulting from rubbing or pawing an uncomfortable eye\n\nFluorescein dye test: a drop of safe dye instilled in the eye. Ulcers or scratches show up bright green when they pick up the special dye. This test also shows whether tears can flow from the eye through a channel to the back of the nose, the tear duct. If the channel is open, green dye appears at the nostrils.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat cherry eye in cats?\n\nTreatment for cherry eye is surgical. It means small operation:\n\nReturning the gland to its proper position\nCreating a small pocket in the third eyelid to tuck the gland in safely\nSecuring the gland in its pocket with dissolvable stitches\n\nThe cost for surgery in the UK will vary depending on the practice, location and any complications affecting surgery. It‚Äôs likely to be hundreds of pounds per eye, including daycare, general anaesthetic for the operation and the operation itself.\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs possible to massage the tear gland back into position if this is done soon after it pops out and before it gets dry or swollen. However, recurrence is so common that this is not offered as an effective treatment option.\n\n¬†\n\nHomecare for cats with cherry eye\n\nThere are no home remedies or cures for cherry eye.\n\nUntil your cat has the operation, and during recovery:\n\nKeep the eye surface clean\nGently bathe twice daily with cooled boiled¬† water and a clean cotton pad\nKeep the eye moist: apply an eye lubricating ointment or gel 1-4 times per day to help prevent damage (for example, Viskyal, Lubrithal, Lacrilube)\nUse a cone collar to prevent damage from scratching or rubbing.\nKeep indoors, especially in dusty or windy conditions.\n\n¬†\n\nCan cherry eye be prevented?\n\nWe can‚Äôt prevent cherry eye. It‚Äôs likely to be a risk from birth in certain breeds.\n\nIdeally, avoid breeding from cats with cherry eye.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about cherry eye\n\nCherry eye is not itself painful or dangerous. However, if untreated, complications can be serious. Complications happen because of infection, severe inflammation or dry eye.\n\nCall a vet as soon as possible if your cat is:\n\nShowing signs of pain and/or infection\nKeeping the eye closed\nDull or depressed, not interested in usual activities\nNot eating\nDeveloping a green discharge from the eye\nDeveloping a sticky grey or green discharge on the eye surface\n\nJoii can help with advice on:\n\nIdentifying cherry eye\nCaring for a cat after eye surgery\nCleaning your cat‚Äôs eyes\nTreating simple eye conditions at home, where appropriate\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

The third eyelid is hidden in the corner of the eye. It‚Äôs almost invisible when your dog‚Äôs eye is open. When your dog blinks, the third eyelid moves over the eye and spreads tears across it. This helps keep the clear part of the eye (the cornea) moist, and helps to remove dust and other small irritants.The third eyelid also has a gland that produces tears.\n\nBut the attachment of the gland to the third eyelid is very loose. Cherry eye happens when the third eyelid tear gland pops out from the underside of the third eyelid.\n\nThe misplaced (prolapsed) gland appears as a pink swelling\nThe cherry eye may come and go at first, but usually needs treatment eventually\nOver time, the exposed gland gets swollen and irritated\nRubbing causes more irritation and damage\nInfection becomes a risk\nThe eye may become dry if the gland can‚Äôt produce tears any more.\nCherry eye is the swelling we see when the tear gland under the third eyelid prolapses\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of cherry eye in dogs\n\nCherry eye is easy to spot when it happens. You can see the prolapsed gland as a lump. It can look like a small cherry in the corner of the eye. That‚Äôs how it gets its name.\n\nCherry eye appears suddenly as a red lump in the corner of one or both eyes\nIt may not bother your dog at first\nOver a few days your dog starts to paw or rub at the eye\nInflammation and infection make the swelling redder and bigger\nGreenish or yellow discharge happens when infection develops\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of getting cherry eye?\n\nCherry eye is most common in the following groups:\n\nYoung dogs under a year old\n\nCertain breeds including:\n\nBrachycephalic (short nosed) breeds like Pug, French Bulldog, English Bulldog, ShihTzu, Lhasa Apso, Pekinese\nCocker Spaniel\nPoodle\nBeagle\nNewfoundland\nGreat Dane\nSt Bernard\n\nThis suggests cherry eye may be a genetic or inherited problem in some breeds or families of dog.\n\nAre my family or other pets at risk of cherry eye?\nCherry eye is not infectious. It won‚Äôt spread between animals or from animals to humans\nOther pets belonging to a susceptible breed may also get cherry eye\nThe condition is inherited. So the risk may be greater for litter mates or puppies of affected dogs\n\n¬†\n\nHow is cherry eye diagnosed?\n\nVets can diagnose cherry eye by its distinctive appearance.\n\nThey may also carry out some additional test to check for:\n\nDry eye: resulting from damage to the prolapsed tear gland.\n\nThe Schirmer tear test is a simple test to check tear production: placing a special indicator paper on the eye surface.\n\nScratches or ulcers on the cornea (the clear ‚Äòwindow‚Äô surface of the eye): resulting from rubbing or pawing an uncomfortable eye\n\nFluorescein dye test: a drop of safe dye instilled in the eye. Ulcers or scratches show up bright green when they pick up the special dye. This test also shows whether tears can flow from the eye through a channel to the back of the nose, the tear duct. If the channel is open, green dye appears at the nostrils.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat cherry eye?\n\nTreatment for cherry eye is surgical. It means small operation:\n\nReturning the gland to its proper position\nCreating a small pocket in the third eyelid to tuck the gland in safely\nSecuring the gland in its pocket with dissolvable stitches\n\nThe cost for surgery in the UK will vary depending on the practice, location and any complications affecting surgery. It will include daycare, general anaesthetic for the operation and the operation itself.\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs possible to massage the tear gland back into position if this is done soon after it pops out and before it gets dry or swollen. However, recurrence is so common that this is not offered as an effective treatment option.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHome care for a dog with cherry eye\n\nThere are no home remedies or cures for cherry eye.\n\nUntil your dog has the operation, and during recovery:\n\nKeep the eye surface clean\nGently bathe twice daily with cooled boiled¬† water and a clean cotton pad\nKeep the eye moist: apply an eye lubricating ointment or gel 1-4 times per day to help prevent damage (for example, Viskyal, Lubrithal, Lacrilube)\nUse a cone collar to prevent damage from scratching or rubbing.\nKeep to lead exercise and avoid walking in dusty or windy conditions.\n\n¬†\n\nCan cherry eye be prevented?\n\nWe can‚Äôt prevent cherry eye. It‚Äôs likely to be a risk from birth.\n\nIdeally, avoid breeding from dogs with cherry eye.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen should you be worried about cherry eye?\n\nCherry eye is not itself painful or dangerous. However, if untreated, complications can be serious and result from infection, severe inflammation or dry eye.\n\nCall a vet as soon as possible if your dog is:\n\nShowing signs of pain and/or infection\nKeeping the eye closed\nDull or depressed, not interested in usual activities\nNot eating\nDeveloping a green discharge from the eye\nDeveloping a sticky grey or green discharge on the eye surface\n\nJoii can help with advice on:\n\nIdentifying cherry eye\nCaring for a dog after eye surgery\nCleaning your dog‚Äôs eyes\nTreating simple eye conditions at home, where appropriate\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Most cases are not serious and clear with prompt treatment. Any breed or age of cat can develop conjunctivitis; however, it is more common in young cats and kittens.\n\nConjunctivitis or ‚Äúpink eye‚Äù is one of the most common causes of red, inflamed eyes in cats. It occurs when the conjunctiva is irritated or infected. Cats can spread some infectious forms to each other. It‚Äôs recommended that you speak to a vet to see if your cat needs medical treatment.\n\nWhat is conjunctivitis in cats and what are the causes?\n\nThis condition refers to redness and inflammation of the conjunctiva.\n\nThe conjunctiva is the tissue that covers the inner surface of the eyelids and the white part of the eye (sclera).\n\nBoth eyes are usually affected, but it can also affect just one.\n\nConjunctivitis is mostly caused by viruses and bacteria.\n\nEye anatomy.\n\nThe most common viruses and bacteria responsible for conjunctivitis are often seen with cat flu disease (such as Herpes virus, Calicivirus, and Chlamydia).\n\nOther causes include:\n\nEye ulcers\nTrauma\nForeign object (such as grass seeds)\nParasites\nImmune-mediated diseases\nSystemic diseases (cats with these diseases usually have other signs of illness) examples: feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), or feline panleukopenia\nAllergies and environmental irritation (dust, smoke, chemicals, air fresheners)\nGlaucoma (a disease that increases the pressure inside of the eye)\nUveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye)\nTear duct diseases\nEyelid and eyelash problems\nEye tumours\n\nIf left untreated the condition can be harder to treat and lead to severe eye issues.\n\n \n\nHow to tell if your cat has conjunctivitis?\n\nYou might see some or all of the following symptoms in your cat:\n\nEye discharge (yellow, green, or clear)\nPink or red eye\nPawing or rubbing at the face\nBlinking more than usual or squinting\nSwelling of the tissue that lines the eyelids and surface of the eye (conjunctiva)\nInner corner of the eye membrane (third eyelid) more pronounced\n\nAre some cats more likely to get conjunctivitis?\n\nHigh population density (such as animal shelters and multi-cat households):\n\nCats that live with multiple other cats are more prone to conjunctivitis due to infectious causes (virus, bacteria).\nGood hand hygiene between handling and medicating infected cats is essential.\nSeparating these cats during the illness period will help prevent the spread of the disease to the other cats.\n\nKittens\n\nAre usually more severely affected than adults because they find it harder to fight infections.\nHowever, the outcome is still very positive, unless the kitten presents with more severe symptoms of cat flu.\n\nCats with a weakened immune system\n\nThese cats may have more difficulties getting rid of the symptoms or may also experience more flare-ups.\nThis includes cats with immune-mediated diseases or systemic infectious diseases (i.e. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), or feline panleukopenia).\n\nStressful environment or episodes of stress: can be a cause of the relapse of infectious conjunctivitis.\n\nFlat-faced cat breeds: Brachycephalic cat breeds such as Persian, Himalayan, and Exotic short-hair are at a higher risk of conjunctivitis due to an increased risk of eyelid and tear duct abnormalities.

In most cases, it can be easily resolved. Treatments include:\n\nGeneral treatment for mild conjunctivitis:\n\nEye cleaners: drops, wipes\nLubricating, soothing treatment: gels, ointments, drops\n\nPrescription medicines depend on the underlying cause:\n\nAnti-viral: oral medication\nAntibiotics: gels, ointments, drops for the eyes or oral medication\nSteroid anti-inflammatory: drops or ointment for the eyes or oral tablets\n\nOther treatments or surgery may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of conjunctivitis. Glaucoma and eyelid problems are two examples.\n\nThings you can do at home to help ease the symptoms of conjunctivitis in your cat\n\nUse sterile saline to flush the eye:\n\nUse a cotton ball soaked in saline solution to flush a few drops into the eye 2-4 times daily.\nClean any accumulated discharge around the eye using a cotton pad.\nSterile saline is available in pharmacies. You can make your own at home by using cooled-down boiled water.\n\nUse a buster collar on your cat: preventing damage to the eye is important, as cats may scratch at their eyes with their paws or rub their faces on furniture.\n\nDo not use human medication on your cat: always speak to a vet first.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to live with a cat with ongoing conjunctivitis\n\nOnce your cat has been seen by a vet, there are some things you can do at home to help this recurrent problem:\n\nWipe their eyes and nose regularly\n\nUse a cotton wool pad soaked in warm water to wipe any discharge from their eyes and nose.\nIt will help your cat feel better, smell their food, breathe more easily, and avoid discharge buildup.\nTake care not to do it too frequently. This can lead to a sore nose and eyes.\n\nReduce stress: keep your cat‚Äôs life as stress-free¬†as possible because stress can make certain illnesses worse or cause a relapse.\n\nIs there any way to prevent conjunctivitis in cats?\n\nIn multi-cat households, conjunctivitis is less likely to spread to other cats if cats with conjunctivitis are separated.\n\nGetting your cat vaccinated against cat flu can help with prevention.\n\nWhen do you need to call the vet¬†if your cat has conjunctivitis?\n\nIf your cat shows any of the following signs, call your local vet:\n\nSquinting or inability to hold the eye(s) open\nSigns of pain, including pawing at the face\nSigns of systemic illness: tiredness, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhoea\nFailure to improve despite treatment\n\nCall us at Joii if your cat has any of the following:\n\nDischarge from the eyes and nose\nEye redness or squinting\nSneezing\nNasal congestion\nCoughing or wheezing\nMouth, nose or lip wounds\nStress\nIf you‚Äôre not sure, it‚Äôs best to be safe\n\n¬†\n\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This is a common problem in older cats. It‚Äôs not usually dangerous in the short term but can become life-threatening if untreated.¬†\n\nConstipation in older cats may not have a specific cause. It can lead to permanent damage to the bowel, a condition called megacolon. Other common causes of constipation include injuries to the pelvis, loss of nerve control (spinal cord disease) and masses in the colon or anus. It is very important to be aware that straining to pee looks very similar in cats, and this is much more urgent. Call a vet if your cat is straining and you‚Äôre unsure why.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if¬† your cat is constipated\n\nIf your cat is constantly going in and out of their tray or showing signs of discomfort, contact a vet straight away.¬†\n\nIf you think your cat hasn‚Äôt pooed for 48 hours, a vet assessment is recommended. This can be more urgent if they are off their food or vomiting.\n\nIf the amount of poo your cat is producing is noticeably less than usual, a vet check is recommended.¬†\n\nPainful or difficult pooing should also be checked, even if the amount seems normal.\n\nHow to tell if your cat is constipated\nSpending a lot of time in the pooing position\nVisibly straining or having abdominal contractions\nCrying or calling, especially in their tray or favourite toileting spot\nPassing only very small amounts of poo or none at all¬†\nStools (poo) are dry and hard, possibly with a small amount of mucus¬†\nVomiting, eating less or becoming quiet and subdued.\n\nCats may not pass stools for a day or two after a bad bout of diarrhoea. This can be normal as long as there is no straining or discomfort.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy is my cat constipated?\nCommon¬† causes of constipation in cats\n\nIn many cats, the gut movement slows down with age. This can lead to build-up of faeces. The end of the intestine becomes dilated, which worsens the problem. This can progress to Megacolon.\n\nInjuries to the bones of the pelvis can reduce the space available for poo to pass through, leading to serious constipation. This may only become noticeable some time after a serious accident or injury.\n\nLack of exercise, obesity or unbalanced diets.\n\nEating too much of things that are hard to digest, like hair or bones. For example, due to overgrooming or hunting.\n\nArthritis or other painful conditions that make straining or positioning to poo difficult.¬†\n\nStress. Some cats can become constipated if they‚Äôve been too stressed to use the litter tray for several days, or if something is putting them off using it.\n\nRare conditions affecting nerve and muscle function.¬†\n\nRare causes of constipation in cats\n\nDysautonomia or other forms of neuromuscular (nerve and muscle) disease¬†\n\nBirth defects\n\nSpinal cord disease\n\nRectal diverticula (deformity on the rectal wall)\n\nOther illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, hypokalemia or hypocalcemia\n\nWhen to worry about constipation\n\nContact a vet straight away if your cat is repeatedly straining without producing anything, especially if they are also vomiting or not eating.\n\nHow to prevent constipation in cats\n\nConstipation due to medical problems usually requires specific medications to prevent repeated episodes.¬†¬†\n\nThe most important thing to prevent constipation is to have a healthy and balanced diet, with the right proportions of the different types of fibre.¬†\n\nGood water intake can help prevent constipation. This can be encouraged by changing the water in the bowl frequently or providing a cat fountain.\n\nDiagnosing constipation in cats\n\nSevere constipation can sometimes be diagnosed on abdominal palpation or rectal examination. This may not be possible in bigger cats or if they are very uncomfortable. A detailed evaluation of the severity of the problem requires x-rays of the abdomen.\n\n¬†How can I help my cat with constipation?¬†\n\nThe right treatment for constipation depends on the cause, so getting a diagnosis is always important.\n\nPreventing dehydration and increasing the water content of the stool is often helpful. Encourage your cat to drink water and, if there is no vomiting, feed wet food or add water to the food.\n\nIf constipation is due to excessive ingestion of hair, a hairball paste may be able to help. This is best discussed with a vet.\n\nWhat is the treatment for constipation in cats?\n\nDepending on the cause of the constipation, there are several medications or procedures your vet may recommend.\n\nIf your cat is dehydrated, it is very important to correct this as quickly as possible.\n\nMild cases can be treated with laxatives. These come in different types:\n\nEmollient laxatives prevent water from being removed from the stool and make it softer.¬†\nLubricant laxatives coat the stool and make it slippery and easier to pass. These are used rectally (given directly into your cat‚Äôs bottom) and are not safe to give by mouth.\nOsmotic laxatives draw water into the stool to make it softer. These are not safe if your cat is dehydrated.\nStimulant laxatives increase gut movements to push the stool onward. This can be done by increasing bulk (fibre products) or stimulating the intestinal wall directly. These laxatives are not safe if there is a physical blockage which is making stool passage impossible.\nSome laxatives will work in more than one way. Lactulose, for example, is both osmotic and stimulant.\n\nThere are medications that directly increase the strength and frequency of intestinal movements, called prokinetics. These are especially useful in cases where the gut is not moving properly, like Megacolon. They can be dangerous if an obstruction is present.\n\nSerious cases of constipation require enemas performed under sedation. This is a procedure where fluid and lubricants are administered directly into the rectum and the faeces are gently removed.\n\nSevere cases may require surgery to empty the colon.\n\nAre some cats more at risk of constipation than others?\n\nOlder cats are at higher risk of constipation, especially if they‚Äôve had it before.¬†\n\nCats that have previously suffered pelvic injuries may also be at higher risk\n\nManx cats are at risk for several conditions that can cause constipation\n\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

If you are worried, speaking to a telemedicine vet may help decide the best thing to do.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat causes coughing in cats?\n\nInfections are common, especially in young cats. These can be viral, like Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, or caused by bacteria like Mycoplasma Felis. These are usually caught from other cats but can stay in the body for some time without causing symptoms.\n\nParasites, such as Lungworm, can also cause coughing. These are usually caught while hunting.\n\nAllergy/Asthma- Allergic bronchial disease or asthma is relatively common in cats and sometimes causes coughing.\n\nForeign bodies, such as blades of grass or seeds, can find their way into a cat‚Äôs windpipe and cause sudden and intense bouts of coughing and retching.\n\nPolyps: Cats can develop small lumps or polyps at the back of their nasal passages. This can lead to coughing.\n\nHeart disease can cause coughing because of fluid build-up in the lungs, this usually happens when the disease is very advanced.\n\nTumours or cancer that have grown or spread to the chest may eventually cause coughing.\n\nRare causes:\n\nCats that are very weak and vomit can sometimes inhale the sick, causing aspiration pneumonia. This can also happen in cats that have diseases that interfere with how they swallow their food.\nElectrocution can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and cause coughing and respiratory problems.\nSevere head trauma can sometimes cause fluid buildup in the lungs as well.\nA Pulmonary Thromboembolism (a blood clot stopping blood flow to a part of the lungs)¬† is another rare cause of coughing.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about coughing in cats\n\nCats are very good at pacing themselves and hiding symptoms if they‚Äôre feeling unwell. It‚Äôs very important to be vigilant when they are unwell, especially with things that affect their breathing. Contact a vet straight away if your cat has any of the following:\n\nTrouble breathing¬†\nWheezing\nOpen-mouth breathing\nPale or bluish gums\nHiding all the time\nNot eating anything\nTired or breathing fast after minimal exercise or movement\n\nEven if no other symptoms are present, a vet check is recommended if the cough is frequent, severe or has been present for more than a week.\n\nPreventing coughing in cats\n\nRegular vaccination against Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus and Feline Leukemia Virus will protect against infection.\n\nRegular deworming treatment will prevent the development of parasitic lung disease. This may need to be done frequently for very active hunters.\n\nPreventative use of a good quality hairball paste can be beneficial, especially for long-haired cats or when they are shedding a lot.\n\nRegular health checks may allow early detection of chronic conditions that can eventually lead to coughing.\n\nDiagnosis of coughing in cats\n\nA basic visual examination can be very useful if concerned about a cough. Evaluating the rate and type of breathing, colour of the gums, general behaviour and body language can assist in determining how serious the problem might be.\n\nListening to your cat‚Äôs chest with a stethoscope tells the vet a lot about the status of the lungs and bronchi.¬†\n\nIf your cat is very unwell, your vet may advise that they stay in a high-oxygen environment for a period of time. This is often life-saving and can also prevent complications during other procedures.\n\nX-rays or ultrasound are frequently recommended. This is to confirm or evaluate the extent of any lung issues suspected on auscultation. It may also detect foreign bodies.\n\nBlood or faecal tests allow diagnosis of some infections. Others require a sample to be obtained from the airways with a swab.\n\nHow to help a cat that is coughing\n\nDo not hesitate to contact a vet if the cough is severe or your cat is unwell in other ways.\n\nYour cat may find it easier to eat and swallow if fed soft, wet food. However, if they prefer to eat dry please make sure this is also available.\n\nTry to avoid exposure to scented candles, diffusers, air fresheners or smoke.\n\nBreathing moist steamy air may help with congestion in their airways. This can be achieved by having them in the bathroom when the shower is being used.\n\nHow a vet can help your coughing cat\n\nGiving oxygen is life-saving if a cat is struggling to breathe.\n\nIf fluid is detected within the lungs, your cat may need to continue receiving oxygen treatment while being given medication to address this.\n\nIf fluid is detected around the lungs, this will need to be drained and a chest drain may need to be placed.\n\nIf a foreign body is suspected, a bronchoscopy or rhinoscopy may be recommended. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed down the throat or up the back of the mouth. This allows the inside of the airways to be examined.\n\nWith certain types of infections, or if cancer is suspected but not seen on x-rays, a broncho-alveolar lavage may be recommended. This is similar to a bronchoscopy, but after visual examination, a small amount of fluid is introduced into the airway and then collected. This allows loose cells in the airway to be collected for analysis.\n\nAre some cats more at risk?\n\nYounger cats are more likely to have an infection or developmental problem\n\nOlder cats are more likely to have heart disease or tumours\n\nCertain breeds such as¬† Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Persian, Sphynx and both American and British Shorthairs are at higher risk for heart disease.\n\nSiamese and Oriental cats have a higher risk of asthma.\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Long-term coughing is commonly caused by tracheal collapse, chronic bronchitis or heart disease.\n\nWhat to do if your dog is coughing\n\nSpeak to a vet straight away if a cough is associated with difficulty breathing, pale or bluish gums, exercise intolerance, reluctance to move or severe lethargy. Emergency treatment may be needed.\n\nIf the cough is mild and they are otherwise well, they may only need monitoring for a few days. See below for a few tips to help them recover. If you are worried, a telemedicine consult with a vet may help decide the best thing to do.\n\nCall your vet for an appointment if your dog has been coughing for more than two weeks, even if the cough is mild and they are otherwise well.\n\nWhat causes coughing in dogs?\nInfections are common, such as Kennel cough. These usually resolve on their own.\nParasites can also cause coughing, such as Lungworm and Heartworm.\nTracheal collapse is a common cause of coughing, especially in small breeds. This is when the windpipe partially folds over itself and narrows the airway. This is a chronic problem but rarely serious.\nLaryngeal paralysis is relatively common, especially in large breed, older dogs. In this condition, the entrance to the airways stops opening fully when the animal breathes in.\nForeign bodies, such as blades of grass or seeds, can find their way into a dog‚Äôs windpipe and cause sudden and intense bouts of coughing and retching.\nHeart disease can cause coughing because of the dilated heart pushing against the bronchi or fluid buildup in the lungs.\nDogs can develop chronic bronchitis as they get older without an obvious cause.\nBrachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome can sometimes cause coughing.\nDiseases that affect swallowing, such as megaoesophagus, can lead to aspiration pneumonia and coughing.\nTumours or cancer that have grown or spread to the chest may eventually cause coughing.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell coughing and reverse sneezing apart. It may help if you make a video of what is happening to show your vet.\n\n\nRare causes of coughing in dogs\nElectrocution, head trauma, strangulation or near-drowning accidents can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and cause coughing and respiratory problems.\nPulmonary Thromboembolism (a blood clot stopping blood flow to a part of the lungs)¬† is a rare cause of coughing. This is more common in dogs suffering from Cushing‚Äôs disease.\nLung lobe torsion, where a¬† part of the lung twists around and stops air flow, is another rare cause of coughing.\nPulmonary Hypertension can also cause coughing. This condition is usually secondary to other diseases, such as heart disease, heartworm, blood clots or Cushing‚Äôs disease.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about coughing in dogs\n\nContact a vet straight away if your dog has any of the following:\n\nTrouble breathing¬†\nWheezing\nPale or bluish gums\nInability to settle down to rest\nNot eating anything\nTired or breathing fast after minimal exercise or movement\n\nEven if no other symptoms are present, a vet check is recommended if the cough is frequent, severe or has been present for more than two weeks.\n\nPreventing coughing in dogs\n\nRegular vaccination against Kennel cough will protect against infection.\n\nRegular deworming treatment may prevent the development of parasitic lung or heart disease. Specific dewormers may be required depending on where you live or travel to.\n\nRegular health checks may allow early detection of heart disease and other conditions.\n\nIf Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome is significant and detected early, corrective surgery may prevent more serious disease in the future.\n\nDiagnosis of coughing in dogs\n\nA basic visual examination can be very useful if concerned about a cough. Evaluating the rate and type of breathing, the colour of the mucous membranes, general behaviour and body language can assist in determining how serious the problem might be.\n\nDetailed auscultation provides a lot of information about the status of the lungs and bronchi.\n\nFrequently, x-rays or ultrasound are recommended. This is to confirm or evaluate the extent of any lung issues suspected on auscultation.\n\nHow to help your coughing dog\n\nDo not hesitate to contact a vet if the cough is severe or your dog is unwell in other ways.\n\nYour dog may find it uncomfortable to eat and swallow. Consider feeding soft or wet food until the cough gets better.\n\nBeing exposed to steam may help with congestion in their airways. This can be achieved by having them in the bathroom when the shower is being used.\n\nCough suppressants are not usually recommended as they may mask the symptoms and worsen the congestion in the airways. Please contact a vet for an assessment before giving any medications.\n\nHow a vet helps a coughing dog\n\nIf your dog is very unwell, your vet may advise that it stays in a high-oxygen environment for a period of time. This is often life-saving and can also prevent complications during other procedures.\n\nFluid or congestion in the lungs will need continued oxygen treatment while being given medication to address this.\n\nWhen fluid is detected around the lungs, this will need to be drained and a chest drain may need to be placed.\n\nIf a foreign body is suspected, a bronchoscopy or rhinoscopy may be recommended. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed down the throat or up the back of the mouth.

It may occur as a result of trauma or due to an inherited weakness. Within one year of undergoing surgery, 20-50% of cases develop a ligament tear in the opposite knee, so treatment should begin as soon as possible to prevent further injury.

It is very rare in cats. It affects many organs and body functions and, in some cases, can be due to cancer.\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome, or hyperadrenocorticism, happens when the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol.¬† This disrupts normal metabolism and causes many problems, such as an increased risk of infections and diabetes. Treatments are available, but most cats have other conditions at the same time, and they often do not do well.\n\nA similar disease can happen in cats that have been on treatment with very high doses of steroids for a long time, but this can be solved by slowly reducing the treatment dose. This must always be done under close monitoring by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Cushing‚Äôs syndrome in cats?\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome is a disease caused by a growth or cyst in one of two organs, the pituitary gland near the brain or the adrenal glands near the kidneys. This growth can sometimes be cancerous.\n\n90% of cats will also have diabetes, and many have kidney or heart disease.\n\nAffects middle-aged and older cats. This is a serious and life-long condition.\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs disease are varied due to the effects of the hormone on many organs.\n\nExcessive drinking and urination are very common, this may lead to toileting accidents in the house.\n\nIncreased appetite is very common.\n\nHair loss and repeated skin infections are frequent, the skin can be easily injured or even torn.\n\nMuscles can become weaker and exercising difficult.\n\nRespiratory infections happen easily and can be difficult to treat.\n\nIncreased sexual behaviour may be noted.\n\nChanges in general behaviour or seizures can happen if the brain becomes affected.\n\nAre some cats at higher risk than others?\n\nThere are no known breed or sex risk factors.\n\nThis disease happens in middle-aged and older cats.\n\nHow is Cushing‚Äôs syndrome diagnosed in cats?\n\nHormones are affected by many diseases and normal body functions, so a combination of symptoms and tests is required.\n\nA basic urine test can detect secondary bacterial infections and kidney problems. A urine cortisol/creatinine ratio can be useful in some cases.\n\nA general blood test can detect typical changes as well as other simultaneous conditions.\n\nAn adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suppression blood test or a low-dose dexamethasone suppression blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIf an adrenal tumour is suspected, an ultrasound may help confirm this.\n\nIf a pituitary tumour is suspected, an MRI may confirm this, but these tumours are very small and not always detectable.\n\nWhat is the treatment for Cushing‚Äôs syndrome?\n\nTrilostane (Vetoryl) is the most common treatment for Cushing‚Äôs disease. It blocks some of the production of cortisol, which helps resolve the symptoms.\n\nSurgery is a treatment option for adrenal tumours, but it is very difficult and rarely performed.\n\nSurgery for pituitary tumours is done in a few hospitals but complications are serious and common.\n\nRadiotherapy has been used with good results.\n\nAs previously mentioned, many cats will have other conditions at the same time, and this may prevent treatment from being effective or increase the risk of side effects.\n\nLiving with a cat with Cushing‚Äôs syndrome\n\nCats with Cushing‚Äôs disease usually have other problems as well, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, and skin problems. These will also require treatment and may be more urgent.\n\nYou may need to have extra water sources and litter trays available to account for the extra thirst and urination.\n\nThe skin can be very fragile and tear easily, so it‚Äôs important to check daily for injuries.\n\nSadly not all cats respond to treatment, and in those that do, the disease is still likely to progress over time. This condition is not known to be painful, but the symptoms and complications have a major impact on quality of life. If treatment is not possible or ineffective, euthanasia may be the kindest option.\n\nAssess quality of life\n\nCan I prevent Cushing‚Äôs syndrome in my cat?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no specific way to prevent Cushing‚Äôs disease.

It‚Äôs the most common hormonal disease in dogs. It affects many organs and body functions. In older dogs, Cushing‚Äôs disease may be due to cancer.\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome, or hyperadrenocorticism, is caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the blood, disrupting normal metabolism. This causes many problems, such as increased risk of some infections and diabetes. Treatment is effective at improving quality of life and reducing complications, but is lifelong and requires frequent monitoring.\n\nA similar disease can happen in dogs that have been on treatment with very high doses of steroids for a long time, but this can be solved by slowly reducing the treatment dose. This must always be done under close monitoring by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome in Dogs?\n\nA growth or cyst in one of two organs, the pituitary gland (near the brain) or the adrenal glands (near the kidneys) causes increased levels of cortisol, which is involved in many different functions in the body. This growth can sometimes be cancerous.\n\nLife expectancy in untreated dogs is 6-18 months, and this can be worse if the growth is cancerous or starts affecting the brain. Quality of life can be seriously affected.\n\nAffects middle-aged and older dogs. This is a serious and chronic condition.\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs disease are varied due to the effects of cortisol on many organs.\n\nExcessive drinking and urination are very common, this may lead to toileting accidents in the house.\n\nIncreased appetite is very common.\n\nHair loss and repeated skin infections are frequent, black spots can sometimes be seen on the skin.\n\nSome dogs will develop a pot-bellied appearance.\n\nMuscles can become weaker and exercising difficult.\n\nPanting can be excessive, even at rest.\n\nChanges in behaviour or seizures can happen if the brain becomes affected.\n\nDogs at higher risk of developing Cushing‚Äôs disease\n\nPituitary tumours, the most common type, are more common in small dogs, especially terriers, dachshunds, and poodles.\n\nAdrenal tumours are more common in older large dogs, especially females.\n\nHow is Cushing‚Äôs syndrome diagnosed?\n\nHormone levels are affected by other diseases and normal body functions. It can be difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis and a combination of symptoms and tests is required.\n\nA urine test to detect the overproduction of urine and secondary bacterial infections is important.¬† A urine cortisol/creatinine ratio can be useful in some cases.\n\nBlood tests are used to check the function of the most important organs.\n\nThe adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suppression test can be used to investigate if a dog has Cushing‚Äôs disease.\n\nThe low-dose dexamethasone suppression test can be used to confirm a diagnosis of Cushing‚Äôs disease and provide some clues as to which organ is the source of the problem.\n\nIf an adrenal tumour is suspected, an ultrasound may help confirm this.\n\nIf a pituitary tumour is suspected, an MRI may confirm this, but these tumours are very small and only detectable 50% of the time.\n\nWhat is the treatment for Cushing‚Äôs syndrome?\n\nTrilostane (Vetoryl) tablets are the most common treatment for Cushing‚Äôs disease. It works by blocking some of the production of cortisol. Frequent monitoring is needed as hormone levels may change over time.\n\nSurgery is a treatment option for adrenal tumours. There is a significant risk of complications and intensive care is needed for several days.\n\nSurgery is also possible for some pituitary tumours, but this is only done in a few hospitals and complications are serious and common.\n\nMitotane is used for chemotherapy when tumours are present. It‚Äôs not commonly used due to its potential side effects.\n\nLiving with a dog with Cushing‚Äôs syndrome\n\nDogs that respond well to treatment will have a normal life, apart from regular vet visits (every 3-6 months when stable, a blood test is often recommended) and daily tablets.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no home remedies shown to help with Cushing‚Äôs syndrome.\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome may mask symptoms from other diseases, such as urinary tract infections and osteoarthritis, and these may need to be treated as well. Call your local vet if you notice any unexpected changes after starting treatment.\n\nOnce your dog is stable, their water intake increasing again may be an early sign that the disease is getting worse. Water intake is considered normal between 20-70 ml/kg/day, but this may vary a lot depending on the water content in food, exercise, temperature, humidity, and other factors.\n\nSadly not all dogs respond to treatment, and in those that do, the disease is still likely to progress over time. This condition is not known to be painful, but the symptoms and complications have a major impact on quality of life. If treatment is not possible or ineffective, euthanasia may be the kindest option.\n\nAssess quality of life\n\nCan I prevent Cushing‚Äôs syndrome in my dog?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no specific way to prevent Cushing‚Äôs disease. A healthy diet and exercise help as with all other health problems.\n\nWhen should you¬†be worried about Cushing‚Äôs syndrome complications\n\nInitial signs that may let you know your dog needs a vet check:\n\nChanges in coat or skin\nChanges in appetite, drinking or urination\nRepeated infections\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nThere is a change in your pet‚Äôs breathing or their tolerance to exercise\nThey are straining to urinate or constantly want to go out\nThe skin or ears become red, smelly, or patchy\nSymptoms that had improved with treatment start to return\n\nChanges in their breathing, in particular, can be urgent.

There are many different causes, but the most common are infections and allergies.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nEar disease can affect cats of all ages, but some breeds may be at greater risk. While many cases are quick and easy to clear up, some causes of ear disease can lead to severe pain, and lifelong treatment may be needed. Ear disease is often referred to as otitis, which means inflammation of the ear.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is ear disease in cats?\n\nEar disease is a common problem that vets see and treat on a daily basis.\n\nThere are many different causes, with bacterial infections and allergies being the most common.\nEar disease can happen at any age\nInfections are usually caused by reduction of air flow and the build-up of moisture\nEar disease may be easy to treat if caught early. Simple infections should clear within 1-2 weeks with appropriate treatment.\nIf not treated early, the ear can become damaged and thickened, and treatment becomes difficult\nSome cats may need lifelong treatment if they have underlying problems like allergies.\nIt‚Äôs important to investigate for underlying causes; otherwise, the ear problems will continue to return\nMay affect different parts of the ear: the ear flap and canal (Otitis externa), middle ear (Otitis media) or inner ear (Otitis interna)\nMost cases of middle or inner ear disease are due to bacteria after a ruptured eardrum. Ruptured ear drums are caused by repeated ear infections or incorrect cleaning.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of ear disease in cats include:\n\nAllergies:¬†Food allergies¬†and environmental\nBacterial and fungal infections\nEar mites and¬†Mange\nForeign bodies (such as grass seeds)\nInjuries, such as cat bite¬†Wounds¬†\nEar growths, such as tumours or polyps\nSolar dermatitis: inflammation of the tip of the ear due to sunlight exposure. More common in cats with white ears.\nVestibular disease in cats\nIncorrect ear cleaning\nEndocrine disorders, such as diabetes\n\nThese conditions can lead to secondary bacterial and yeast infections in the ears. Severe head shaking can lead to an aural haematoma.\n\nEar disease can be very painful in cats, and if not treated quickly, it may lead to lifelong problems and deafness.

These breeds are at higher risk due to the abnormal shape of the ear.\nRegular exposure to moisture, such as too frequent or incorrect cleaning\nKittens and outdoor cats are more at risk of ear mites\nTumours and masses are more common in older cats\nImmunocompromised cats, such as those with FIV or FeLV are at a higher risk of developing ear infections\nIs my family at risk of catching ear disease from cats?\n\nNone of the common causes of ear disease are known to transfer from cats to humans.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is ear disease diagnosed in cats?\n\nThe diagnosis of ear disease will usually begin with a full physical exam, including an otoscopic exam. Your vet will look down the ear canal with a scope to check the eardrum and check for any abnormalities, such as foreign bodies or growths.\n\nDepending on the findings, further tests may include\n\nA swab of the ear, for cytology, to find out if bacteria, yeast, mites or other cells are present\nA swab may be sent off to see what medication is best to treat the infection\nEar flushing, to clean the ear thoroughly\nA biopsy of the skin or any growths in the ear\nImaging: Skull x-rays, CT or MRI may be recommended for certain conditions, especially those affecting the middle and inner ear\nOther tests to check for underlying diseases include diet trials, allergy skin testing, and blood and urine tests.\n\nThe above tests often require sedation or anaesthesia. Ear disease can be extremely painful, and some cats may not even allow a visual exam without it.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment of ear disease in cats\n\nYour vet may diagnose an ear infection based on how the ear looks and a simple swab of the ear discharge.\n\nA visual exam is extremely important to check that the eardrum is intact, as most ear drops can cause severe side effects if used when the eardrum is not intact.\n\nTreatment will usually involve one or more of the following:\n\nEar cleaners\nTo clean and soothe the ear canal\nHelp break up the wax and allow the medicated drops to be more effective\nSome have antibacterial and antifungal properties\nMedicated ear drops\nUsually contain a combination of antibiotic, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory ingredients.\nRange of different types; some are applied twice daily, some are longer-lasting, up to a week\nOften used after a swab has been taken, once results are known for what type of bacteria or yeast is present\nThe length of course may range from 7 days to 14 days or longer, depending on how severe the infection is or what type of infection is present\nAlways complete the course as advised by your vet\nOral medications\nMay be used if ear drops are not possible due to too much pain or a ruptured eardrum\nOften used if middle or inner ear disease is involved\nMay be used before a course of ear drops to help reduce thickening inside the ear canal\nThe most common are antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications\nSurgery\nSimple procedures such as ear flushing (to thoroughly clean the ears) or removal of foreign bodies\nRemoval of the tip of the ear if severe solar dermatitis is present\nMore complex surgery may be required for ear problems that are not clearing with medical treatment or badly damaged ears\nThere are several different techniques: lateral wall resection, vertical ear canal ablation, and total ear canal ablation (TECA).\n\nOther treatments may be necessary for any of the underlying diseases, such as ear mites.

Although it‚Äôs more common in large- and giant-breed dogs, it can also affect small and medium breeds. Dogs with elbow dysplasia often develop arthritis even after surgery, requiring lifelong management.\n\nElbow dysplasia is the name given to a group of conditions that affects the elbow during abnormal growth of the elbow joint. Elbow dysplasia cannot be cured but it can be well managed in order to improve quality of life.\n\nWhat is elbow dysplasia in dogs?\n\nThe elbow joint is made up of three bones that come into contact: the radius, the ulna, and the humerus.\n\nAnatomy of the elbow\n\nIf the bones do not fit together perfectly, different problems can occur.\n\nElbow dysplasia consists of one or more of the following problems:\n\nUnunited anconeal process (UAP): A portion of the ulna bone (the anconeal process) fails to fuse during growth.\nFragmented coronoid process (FCP): The small bony projection on the ulna (the coronoid process) is separated from the rest of the ulna by trauma or growth abnormality. This results in a fragment of bone floating in the elbow joint region.\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD): A piece of cartilage from the surface of the humerus becomes loose within the joint space, resulting in abnormal cartilage wear and pain.\nElbow incongruity: The radius and ulna grow at different rates, resulting in instability of the joint.\n\nIn all cases, elbow dysplasia leads to joint wear, instability, inflammation, and eventually pain and arthritis.\n\nWith treatment, 85% of cases will show some degree of improvement in lameness and comfort despite the progression of arthritis.\n\nWhat are the signs of elbow dysplasia in dogs?\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your dog:\n\nLimping\nStiffness after exercise or after prolonged periods of rest\nHolding the elbow away from the body when walking\n\nSigns often occur in older puppies (5 to 8 months of age). However, it may not be diagnosed until adulthood.\n\nWhich dogs are at risk of elbow dysplasia?\n\nThe cause of elbow dysplasia in dogs remains unclear.\n\nDifferent factors are believed to cause growth disturbances, and consequently elbow dysplasia.\n\nAmong the causes are:\n\nHereditary factors: Commonly seen in large to giant breed dogs such as Bernese Mountain Dogs, German Shepherds, Golden and Labrador Retrievers, among others.\nNutrition: Puppies that grow too quickly or become obese due to inappropriate feeding.\nTrauma: High impact accident that injures the bones and cartilage.\n\nHow vets diagnose elbow dysplasia in dogs\n\nTo help determine whether your dog has elbow dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your dog‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\n\nYour vet may also need to refer your dog to a specialist vet in a referral hospital for more advanced diagnostic procedures such as:\n\nCT scans\nMRI scans\nArthroscopy (a camera inside the joint)\n\nHow to treat elbow dysplasia in dogs\n\nTreatment consists of surgery and medical management.\n\nSurgery is usually necessary. But in these cases, medical management still plays a very important role.\n\nYour vet may recommend only medical treatment if the problem is so mild or severe that routine surgery is unlikely to benefit the joint.\n\n¬†\n\nSurgery\n\nOften surgery is best performed using arthroscopy (using a camera in the joint), but conventional open surgery can also be done.\n\nSurgery may involve the following procedures, depending on the problem:\n\nRemoval of any bone fragments and removal of loose cartilage.\nReattachment or removal of the anconeal process.\nSurgical alteration of the elbow joint to improve joint fit or shift weight away from damaged areas.\nJoint replacement if the elbow is severely damaged.\n\n¬†\n\nMedical management\n\nMedical management is used to minimize pain and slow the progression of arthritis. For better results, all of the following will be needed:\n\nJoint supplements\nAnti-inflammatory and painkiller medication\nWeight control and weight loss\nExercise modification\nPhysiotherapy and rehabilitation\nComplementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage, stem cell therapy, and laser therapy\n\nHow to help your dog with elbow dysplasia at home\nKeep your dog slim\n\nIt is important that your dog maintains an ideal BCS of 4-5 to prevent excessive weight on their joints.\n\nYou can achieve this by:\n\nUsing a weight control diet.\nMaking sure you are given the correct amount and frequency of food per day.\nAvoiding extra treats or choosing healthy and low-calorie treats.\nAvoiding giving human food.\nExercising your dog enough and correctly.\nContacting a vet nurse for guidance.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nControlled exercise during painful episodes\n\nExercise should be restricted during any flare-up of lameness.\n\nYour dog should not run, jump, use stairs, or have any boisterous activity for a period of three weeks.\n\nWe suggest:\n\nMind/puzzle games to keep them busy\nKeeping your dog on the lead\nShort walks, on average a 10 minutes walk 3-4 times a day\n\n¬†\n\nCold therapy during painful episodes\n\nApplying cold to the elbows after a flare-up of lameness can reduce inflammation and pain in a natural way.\n\nFor most dogs, applying a cold pack to the elbows for 10 minutes, especially after exercise, can be helpful.\n\nWe recommend you contact a vet before applying cold therapy to your dog.\n\n¬†\n\nAdapting activity levels for long-term management\n\nIn the long term, your dog may benefit from short and frequent walks, and you will learn what they can cope with.\n\nThe following guidelines are recommended:\n\nAdapt your routine.\nAvoid vigorous off-lead exercise, which will put excessive stress on their elbows.\nExercise patterns should be regular: avoid short walks during the week and long walks during the weekend.\nAvoid hard, irregular landscapes and soft sand beaches. Choose flat, short grass instead.\nAvoid tricky obstacles\nConserve energy to get home\nTake a break during the walk\nSo many joint supplements are available, which one should you choose?\n\nThe key ingredient a joint supplement should contain is:\n\nGreen-lipped mussel extract (a bivalve mollusc extract)\nOmega-3&6 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids)\n\nOther ingredients that may also have an effect are:\n\nDPLA (a protein that is believed to have pain relief and mood-elevating effects)\nSAMe (a compound found naturally in the body)\nCBD (an active ingredient in cannabis extracted from the hemp plant)\nHyaluronic acid (a component of joint fluid that gives it elasticity)\nChondroitin sulphate (extracted from mammalian cartilage, normally cow windpipes)\nCollagen hydrolysates (also known as gelatin, it‚Äôs made from collagenous structures of mammals such as bovine tendons)\nGlucosamine (a natural compound found in cartilage)\nVitamin E\n\n¬†\n\nAre physiotherapy and rehabilitation that important?\n\nIn order to improve limb function and quality of life, this condition typically requires expensive surgery and physiotherapy.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬† The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nHydrotherapy: National Association of Registered Canine Hydrotherapists, Canine Hydrotherapy Association\nLaser therapy\nAcupuncture: Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\nMagnetic field therapy\nChiropathy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), British Veterinary Chiropractic Association (BVCA)\nOsteopathy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), European Veterinary Society for Osteopathy (EVSO)\nMassage\nHomoeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\nElectrohydraulic shockwave therapy\n\nCan elbow dysplasia in dogs be prevented?\n\nNot all cases of elbow dysplasia can be prevented. Nevertheless, there are some steps you can take to reduce your dog‚Äôs risk of developing this disease.\n\nCheck breed characteristics:\n\nResearch the breed before getting a new dog.\nFind a responsible breeder who performs health screening and genetic control tests.\n\nRegular vet health checks:\n\nFor early diagnosis and to help monitor any relevant changes.\nPuppies at high risk of elbow dysplasia need to be closely monitored in the first 5-8 months of life.\n\nDiet and nutrition:\n\nAs your dog grows, providing them with appropriate exercise and a healthy diet will help prevent obesity.\nIt is vital that you provide your dog with the correct food and quantity based on the breed and stage of development.\nFor help reach out to a vet nurse.\n\nExercise with caution:\n\nStaying fit and exercising regularly will help your dog‚Äôs muscles stay strong and reduce joint stress.\nDogs with elbow dysplasia should never be exercised to the point of fatigue.\nAvoid high impact, sharp starts or stops, twisting, and repetitive movements such as ball throwing for prolonged periods.\n\nNeutering guidance:\n\nIf you plan to have your dog neutered, do so with guidance regarding the most appropriate age for their breed.\nScreening programmes are available to check that a dog has healthy elbows before mating.\nAs the disease is hereditary, it is recommended not to breed a dog with elbow dysplasia.\n\nWhen to worry if your dog has elbow dysplasia\n\nCall your vets if your dog shows any of these signs:\n\nNot improving or worsening despite treatment\nLoss of appetite\nVomiting or diarrhoea, especially if taking medications\nIncreased drinking or urination\nTiredness\n\nJoii can help with:\n\nidentifying pain in your dog\npreventing arthritis in your dog\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Around 1 in 500 cats in the UK have more than one seizure. One quarter of these have epilepsy. It‚Äôs most common in adult to middle-aged cats. Severity, treatment and outlook depend on the underlying cause.¬†\n\nSeizures happen when there‚Äôs an uncontrolled flare of electrical activity in your cat‚Äôs brain. Epilepsy means your cat has repeated seizures. Seizures look scary, but they‚Äôre not painful, and they usually only last a minute or two. However, your cat may seem sleepy and out of sorts for several hours afterwards. Seizures are exhausting. They can damage both the body and the brain if they last too long or happen multiple times in a short period of time. There‚Äôs no cure for epilepsy. However, with veterinary care and daily medication to prevent seizures, many cats continue to enjoy a full and active life at home.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is epilepsy in cats?\n\nEpilepsy in cats is caused by an abnormality of the brain.\n\nThis abnormality causes seizures, which may be general (whole body) or partial. Not all cats who have an unexplained seizure have epilepsy. Cats may have a single seizure and never have another in their lifetime.\n\nThere are 3 types of epilepsy in cats:\n\nIdiopathic Epilepsy\nCauses seizures without structural changes in the brain or an obvious cause\nMuch less common than in dogs.\nIs an inherited (genetic) disease in dogs. Less certain in cats.\nStructural Epilepsy\nSeizures where there is damage to the structure of the brain\nCauses of damage include head trauma, inflammation of the brain (FIV, FeLV, Toxoplasmosis, FIP, Rabies, meningitis), a stroke, a brain tumour or a birth defect\nEpilepsy of unknown cause\nA structural cause is suspected but not identified with testing\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of epilepsy in cats\n\nThere can be up to four stages associated with epilepsy in cats:\n\n¬†\n\nEarly warning phase or ‚ÄòProdrome‚Äô\n\nSome cats develop behaviour changes in the hours or days before an epileptic seizure.\n\nSymptoms are vague and variable but can include:\n\nRestlessness\nAttention-seeking\nAnxious behaviour\n\nVets call this the ‚Äòprodrome‚Äô.\n\n¬†\n\nImmediately before the seizure ‚Äì the ‚ÄòAura‚Äô\n\nShortly before a seizure, cats may experience an aura. Signs, if present, are the same as the prodrome.\n\n¬†\n\nThe seizure or ‚ÄòIctus‚Äô\n\nSeizures in cats can be focal (partial) or whole body (complete or generalised).\n\nSymptoms of a focal or partial seizure include:\n\nTwitching face muscles and trembling\nDrooling\nRapid running\nDilated pupils\nPassing poo or wee\n\nSymptoms of a whole body seizure:\n\nBecoming unsteady, losing balance\nFalling over, with stiffened muscles\nBecoming vacant or unconscious\nLying on one side and jerking their limbs\nDrooling saliva\nMaking chomping and biting movements\nPassing faeces (poo) or urine (wee) without being aware of it\n\nSeizures usually only last for a minute or two.\n\nFocal seizures may rapidly develop into full body ones.\n\nProlonged seizures are dangerous.\n\nCall¬† your nearest vet immediately if your cat‚Äôs seizure has been going on for longer than 3 minutes\n\n¬†\n\nAfter a seizure ‚Äì the ‚ÄòPost Ictal phase‚Äô¬†\n\nAfter a seizure, your cat may be:\n\nAggressive\nDisorientated\nVery hungry and thirsty\nSeeming blind or deaf\nLooking wobbly or ‚Äòdrunk‚Äô\n\nThis is known as the post-ictal phase. Ictus is another name for a seizure. It‚Äôs best to leave your cat to recover safely and peacefully in their familiar surroundings until this passes.\n\nThere can be many other symptoms of ‚Äòfull‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô seizures.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of Epilepsy than others?\nEpilepsy is most common in adult to middle-aged cats\nBreed, size and sex don‚Äôt affect the likelihood of epilepsy in cats\nAre my Family and other pets at risk?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by an abnormality in the brain of an individual cat.\n\nIt cannot spread between cats or from cats to their owners and other pets in the household.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is epilepsy diagnosed?\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a single test for epilepsy.\n\nVets gather information and use the following tests to find the cause of seizures:\n\nHistory: your account of what happened and your cat‚Äôs general health\nGeneral and neurological examination: checking things like balance and eyesight\nBlood and urine tests to check for liver or kidney disease, low blood sugar or abnormal electrolyte (salt) levels. All of these can cause seizures. Finding a cause like this means the seizure is not idiopathic epilepsy\nMRI or CT scans: vets may recommend a closer examination of your cat‚Äôs brain using advanced tests to check the brain‚Äôs structure.\nTests on samples of fluid taken from around the brain, called the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF.\n\nThese tests may reveal a cause of Structural epilepsy.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy is diagnosed when cats have repeated seizures and tests don‚Äôt identify an underlying cause.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat cats with epilepsy?\n\nAlthough the disease cannot be cured, with the right medication and veterinary care,¬†many cats with epilepsy can go on to live full and active lives. The outlook will depend on what caused the epilepsy.\n\nOutlook is best for cats with idiopathic epilepsy (unknown cause)\n\n¬†\n\nEmergency treatment in practice\n\nIn emergencies, vets inject sedatives and anti-seizure medicine directly into your cat‚Äôs veins to control seizures.\n\nAn emergency is a seizure which lasts more than 3 minutes or happens repeatedly in a short period.\n\n¬†\n\nPrescription treatment for Epilepsy at home\n\nLonger-term treatment for idiopathic epilepsy includes:\n\nAnti-seizure medicine given daily as tablets or liquid\nEmergency medication for at home treatment of seizures lasting more than 3 minutes\n\nMedicine by mouth for epilepsy:\n\nFirst-line choices:\n\nPhenobarbitone\nPotassium Bromide\nImepitoin\n\nAdditional medication is prescribed if your cat‚Äôs seizures aren‚Äôt controlled well enough by the above:\n\nLevetiracetam\nZonisamide\nGabapentin\n\n¬†\n\nEmergency treatment at home\n\nIf your cat has epilepsy, your vet may give you medicine to use at home to control seizures which go on too long.\n\nRectal Diazepam ‚Äì given into your cat‚Äôs bottom for rapid effect\n\n¬†\n\nCaring for a cat with epilepsy at home\nThere are no home remedies for epilepsy in cats\n\nCats with epilepsy need lifelong treatment with prescription medicine from a vet.\n\nMedication for epilepsy can have side effects. If your cat is being treated for epilepsy, they will need to see a vet for regular check-ups. This should be at least every 6 months.\n\nRegular check-ups include:\n\nIdentifying frequency of seizures and any changes in general health\nPhysical examination\nBlood tests\nChecking levels of phenobarbitone\nChecking for evidence of liver damage or other health concerns\n\n¬†\n\nTips for living with a cat with epilepsy:\nWhat to do if you think your pet is having a seizure\nStay calm\nTurn down the lights\nKeep the room quiet\nTry not to touch your cat during the seizure\nRemove children and other pets from the room\nKeep your cat safe from injuring themselves\nCare! Avoid risk of injury if aggression is part of your cat‚Äôs seizure\n\nCall your nearest vet if your cat‚Äôs seizure is lasting more than 3 minutes¬†\n\nSpeak to a vet if your cat has more than one seizure in a day.\n\nHow can you tell if a seizure is about to happen?\n\nSome pets with epilepsy show changes in behaviour in the time leading up to a seizure.

Around 1 in 100 dogs in the UK will have a fit at some time in their lives. Although dogs of any age, sex or breed can have a seizure, epilepsy is most common in young adult dogs and in certain breeds, including Pugs, French Bulldogs Belgian Shepherd dogs, Border collies and Labradors. Severity, treatment and outlook depend on the cause of your dog‚Äôs epilepsy.¬†\n\nSeizures happen when there‚Äôs an uncontrolled flare of electrical activity in your dog‚Äôs brain. Seizures look scary, but they‚Äôre not painful, and they usually only last a minute or two. However, your dog may seem sleepy and out of sorts for several hours afterwards. Seizures are exhausting. They can damage both the body and the brain if they last too long or happen multiple times in a short period of time. There‚Äôs no cure for epilepsy. However, with veterinary care and daily medication to prevent seizures, most dogs continue to enjoy a full and active life at home.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is epilepsy in dogs?\n\nEpilepsy in dogs is caused by an abnormality of the brain.\n\nThis abnormality causes seizures, which may be general (whole body) or partial. Not all dogs who have an unexplained fit have epilepsy. Dogs may have a single seizure and never have another in their lifetime.\n\nThere are three types of epilepsy in dogs:\n\nIdiopathic Epilepsy\nThe most common form of epilepsy and the most common cause of repeated fits or seizures in dogs between 1 and 6 years old\nCauses seizures without structural changes in the brain or an obvious cause\nIs an inherited (genetic) disease in dogs\nStructural Epilepsy\nSeizures where there is damage to the structure of the brain\nCauses of damage include head trauma, inflammation of the brain, a stroke, a brain tumour or a birth defect\nEpilepsy of unknown cause\nA structural cause is suspected but not identified with testing\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of epilepsy in dogs\nSymptoms of a full body (complete or generalised) seizure\nBecoming unsteady, losing balance\nFalling over, with stiffened muscles\nBecoming vacant or unconscious\nLying on one side and jerking their limbs\nDrooling saliva\nMaking chomping and biting movements\nPassing faeces (poo) or urine (wee) without being aware of it\nSymptoms of a partial (or focal) seizure\nMuscle twitches\n‚ÄòVacant‚Äô episodes: staring into space\nWeakness on one side of the body\n\nSeizures usually only last for a minute or two. Prolonged seizures are dangerous, causing exhaustion and brain damage.\n\nCall your nearest vet immediately if your dog‚Äôs seizure has been going on for longer than 5 minutes.\n\nCall and speak to a Joii vet at any time for support and advice if your dog has had a seizure.\n\nFor a period of minutes to hours after the seizure, your dog may appear:\n\nDisorientated\nWobbly on their legs\nVery hungry\nVery sleepy\n\nThis is known as the post-ictal phase. Ictus is another name for a seizure. It‚Äôs best to leave your pet to recover safely and peacefully in their familiar surroundings until this passes.\n\nThere can be many other symptoms of full or partial seizures.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of Epilepsy than others?\n\nWhilst all dogs may be at risk of seizures, certain breeds are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, according to the Kennel Club.\n\nThe breeds most commonly affected include:\n\nPugs\nBoxers\nFrench Bulldogs and Bulldogs\nBelgian Shepherd Dogs\nBorder Terriers\nStaffordshire Bull Terriers\nLabrador Retrievers\nJack Russell Terriers\nYorkshire Terriers\n\nThe reason for this increased risk is unknown, but it may be due to a faulty gene.\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of epilepsy?\n\nEpilepsy results from an abnormality in the brain of an individual dog.\n\nIt won‚Äôt spread between dogs, or from dogs to their owners and other pets in the household.\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of epilepsy in dogs\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a single test for epilepsy\n\nVets gather information and use the following tests to find the cause of seizures:\n\nHistory: your account of what happened and your dog‚Äôs general health\nGeneral and neurological examination: checking things like balance and eyesight\nBlood and urine tests to check for liver or kidney disease, low blood sugar or abnormal electrolyte (salt) levels. All of these can cause seizures. Finding a cause like this means the seizure is not idiopathic epilepsy.\nMRI or CT scans: vets may recommend a closer examination of your dog‚Äôs brain using advanced tests to check the brain‚Äôs structure.\nTests on samples of fluid taken from around the brain, called the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF.\n\nThese tests may reveal a cause of structural epilepsy.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy is diagnosed when dogs have repeated seizures and tests fail to identify a cause.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat epilepsy in dogs?\n\nThe good news is that most dogs who experience seizures due to epilepsy can go on to live full and active lives. Although the disease cannot be cured, with the right medication and veterinary care, you and your canine best friend can continue to do all the things you enjoy together.\n\nIn emergencies, vets inject sedatives and anti-seizure medicine directly into your dog‚Äôs veins to control seizures. An emergency is a seizure which lasts more than 5 minutes or happens repeatedly in a short period of time.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatments for epilepsy at home\n\nLonger-term treatment for idiopathic epilepsy includes:\n\nAnti-seizure medicine given daily as tablets or liquid\nEmergency medication for ‚Äòat home‚Äô treatment of seizures lasting more than 3 minutes\n\nMedicine by mouth for epilepsy:\n\nFirst line choices:\n\nPhenobarbitone\nPotassium Bromide\nImepitoin\n\nAdditional medication is prescribed if your dog‚Äôs seizures aren‚Äôt controlled well enough by the above:\n\nLevetiracetam\nZonisamide\nGabapentin\nEmergency treatment at home\n\nIf your dog has epilepsy, your vet may give you medicine to use at home to control seizures which go on too long.\n\nRectal Diazepam: given into your dog‚Äôs bottom for rapid effect\nOngoing Vet Care\n\nMedication for epilepsy can have side effects. If your dog is being treated for epilepsy, they will need to see a vet for regular check-ups. This should be at least every 6 months.\n\nRegular check-ups include:\n\nFinding out how your dog has been since the previous check-up:\n\nIdentifying frequency of seizures and any changes in general health\n\nPhysical examination\n\nBlood tests:\n\nChecking levels of phenobarbitone\nChecking for evidence of liver damage or other health concerns\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with Epilepsy at home\nWhat to do if you think your dog is having an epileptic seizure\nStay calm\nTurn down the lights\nKeep the room quiet\nTry not to touch your dog during the seizure\nRemove children and other pets from the room\nKeep your dog safe from injuring themselves\n\nCall your nearest vet if your dog‚Äôs seizure is lasting more than 5 minutes.\n\nSpeak to a vet if your dog has more than one seizure in a day.\n\n¬†\n\nCaring for your dog on epilepsy medicine\nGive prescribed medication from your vet at the right time and the prescribed dose.\nDon‚Äôt give supplements or herbal remedies without consulting a vet.

This is a common and contagious disease that can also result in eye problems. In healthy cats, it is usually not serious, unlike in kittens and adult cats with underlying illnesses.\n\nCat flu is also called Feline Upper Respiratory Disease Complex. Cats can catch this virus through direct contact with an infected cat or contaminated objects. The illness is typically brief, lasting from 7 to 21 days. Yet, some cats can develop life-long or recurrent signs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is cat flu?\n\nCat flu is a general term for a disease with symptoms that involve the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat) and eyes. These include sneezing, a snotty nose, and weepy eyes.\n\nCat flu can be caused by two types of viruses (calcivirus and herpes virus) and two types of bacteria (Bordetella bronchiseptica¬†and¬†Chlamydophila felis).\n\nCats infected with herpes virus become lifetime carriers and have symptoms of cat flu on and off throughout their life.\n\nThis disease spreads very easily, usually through sneezing. Cat flu carriers may still spread the disease, despite looking healthy.\n\nThere are vaccines available.¬† This is not a guaranteed defence but will make them more resistant to the disease.\n\nCat flu is usually viral, meaning that antibiotics won‚Äôt be effective in most cases.\n\nSince kittens can be severely affected, we recommend you contact a vet if you suspect they have cat flu.\n\nBordetella bronchiseptica is the bacteria that causes kennel cough in dogs.\n\nRespiratory tract anatomy in cats\n\nSymptoms of cat flu\nSneezing\nSnotty nose\nWeepy eyes\nRed eyes\nSquinting eyes\nCoughing\nFever\nDifficulty breathing\nNoisy breathing\nLack of appetite\nDifficulty eating\nTiredness\n\n¬†\n\nIs your cat at risk?\n\nYoung cats, elderly cats, and cats with other illnesses¬†can be more prone to showing signs of disease. This is mainly because their immune system isn‚Äôt very strong.\n\nCats living in a high population density, such as cat shelters or multi-cat households, can also be more likely to catch this.\n\nBefore taking your cat to a cattery, make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations.\n\nIf you are a dog owner too and your dog has been diagnosed with kennel cough, it is better to keep cat and dog separate.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is cat flu diagnosed?\n\nVets usually diagnose cat flu based on:\n\nHistory taking\nCat‚Äôs symptoms\nHands-on examination\n\nOn some occasions, vets may need to do further testing, such as:\n\nDye test on the eye\nTear production test\nTesting for viruses\nBacterial culture and sensitivity testing\nBlood tests to check for other illnesses affecting the body\nTaking x-rays\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for cat flu?\n\nMost cases of cat flu are mild and easily managed with medication to ease symptoms.\n\nThere is no cure for cat flu caused by herpes virus, but there are many things that can reduce the symptoms and help the body fight the infection.\n\nThe treatment may differ in mild and severe cases and may include some of the following:\n\nEye drops or ointments\nAnti-inflammatories\nOral antiviral medications\nAntibiotics (if bacterial infections are present or pneumonia is suspected)\nAppetite stimulants\nMedication that stimulates the immune system\nHumidifiers or nasal saline drops to help with nasal congestion\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with flu at home\n\nFollowing your vet‚Äôs treatment recommendations\n\nClean their eyes and nose\n\nThis will help them smell their food and breathe more easily.\nUse cotton wool soaked in warm water to wipe any discharge from their eyes and nose.\n\nHelp them breathe better¬†\n\nPlace them in a steamy room (i.e. the bathroom while you‚Äôre showering). This will help break down some of the thick mucus in their airways, allowing them to breathe better.\nOr you may use a humidifier or nebulizer to clear the nasal passage.\n\nHelp them eat\n\nAdd small pieces of warm, smelly food to their meals (e.g. sardines, anchovies, tuna, chicken).\n\nReduce stress\n\nA low-stress environment is very important.\nCats are very sensitive to stress, which can lead to a recurrence of the disease.\nWhat to expect if your pet has cat flu?\nWhat is the outcome for a cat with cat flu?\n\nMost cats respond well and quickly to medical treatment and live normal lives.\n\nSome cats may need extra medication or assistance to help with flare-ups if they happen often or are very severe.\n\n¬†\n\nHow long will cat flu be contagious?\n\nCats can remain infectious for up to 3 weeks after showing signs of illness.\n\nDo not allow these pets to interact with other cats, especially kittens during this time.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat happens if cat flu is left untreated?\n\nViral diseases can progress and allow bacterial infections to develop. This can lead to complications such as pneumonia, much like in human flu.\n\n¬†\n\nCan cat flu have long-term effects?\n\nSometimes they can be left suffering from a permanently runny nose, called chronic rhinitis.\n\nCats that have repeated eye infections and corneal ulcerations may develop permanent scarring of the surface of the eye.\n\nIn severe cases, some cats will suffer from ongoing inflammation of the mouth and gums ‚Äì gingivitis. This requires medical treatment and, occasionally, tooth extractions.\n\nPeriods of stress may bring on repeated episodes of cat flu if your cat is a lifelong carrier.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent cat flu\n\nVaccination\n\nVaccines can prevent infection or prevent cats from becoming lifelong carriers.\nWhen cats are already infected, vaccines will help reduce the severity of the signs of disease.\n\nReduce stress\n\nTo help prevent the recurrence of disease in lifelong carriers.\n\nProvide excellent nutrition\n\nTo help support a strong immune system.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen do you need to call the vet?¬†\n\nIf your cat shows any of the following signs,¬†call your local vet now:\n\nSquinting or being unable to hold the eye(s) open\nDifficulty breathing, open-mouth breathing (cats don‚Äôt pant, this is an emergency)\nFailure to improve despite treatment\n\nIf your cat is showing one or more of the following signs,¬†call us at Joii:\n\nDischarge from the eyes and nose\nEye redness or squinting\nSneezing\nNasal congestion\nCoughing or wheezing\nLack of appetite\nStress in the household\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Stress and intense exercise commonly cause fast breathing, but if these are not the cause or the breathing isn‚Äôt returning to normal, a serious condition may be present.\n\nMost cats will only breathe with their mouth open if they are very stressed or have a serious problem. Normal breathing movements in cats are very subtle and silent. Any breathing changes lasting more than a few minutes should be discussed with a vet, and this is urgent if the breathing is getting worse or if it is noisy or laboured.\n\nRecording breaths per minute at rest is a useful way to monitor chronic conditions, especially those affecting the heart and lungs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my cat is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and remove anything that may cause stress for your cat.

It is more common in dogs, but cats can also be affected. Other parasites can be contracted during hunting and roaming. Regular deworming, flea and mite control with good quality products can prevent problems.\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of fast breathing in cats\n\nIf your cat‚Äôs breathing rate is increased, your vet will:\n\nexamine your cat\nlisten to their chest\ncheck their temperature\nrecommend blood tests\ndiscuss x-rays and scans\n\n¬†\n\nHome remedies for fast breathing in cats\n\nThere are no home treatments for fast breathing in cats.\n\nIf your cat has started breathing fast suddenly and is not recovering quickly, please take your cat to see a vet immediately.\n\nTake their respiratory rate while they are asleep. This means counting how many breaths they take in one minute.\n\nIf their breathing isn‚Äôt settling down and they are showing other signs of being unwell, please contact a vet as soon as possible.\n\nIf your cat has an underlying condition, please give medications as advised by your vet.\n\nReport any changes in their condition back to your vet as soon as possible.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for fast breathing in cats\n\nBy the time breathing changes become obvious, cats are usually oxygen deprived and need to have oxygen administered to them. This is usually done by placing them in a special box with high levels of oxygen flowing through it.\n\nIf there is fluid around the lungs, this will need to be drained. This procedure is called thoracocentesis.\n\nIf the airway is collapsed or there is an obstruction that cannot be immediately removed, a tube may need to be inserted directly into the windpipe, via tracheostomy.\n\nAsthma is treated with bronchodilators and steroids, either by nebulisation (a small machine used to give medication as a mist) or injection.\n\nInfections are usually treated with antibiotics.\n\nFever is usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPain is treated with analgesic medications such as opioids.\n\nTrauma to the chest or abdomen may require emergency surgery.\n\nPulmonary oedema, fluid in the lungs, is treated with diuretics.\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk for breathing problems\n\nSiamese and Oriental cats are at higher risk for asthma, mediastinal lymphoma (a type of cancer) and chylothorax (a type of fluid build-up in the chest)\n\nMaine Coons and Ragdolls are at higher risk for some types of heart disease\n\nCats that roam and fight are at higher risk for trauma and infection\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of fast breathing\n\nHeat stroke is rare in cats but possible in extreme conditions, such as in cars\n\nParacetamol is very toxic to cats and disrupts their red blood cells, causing breathing problems\n\nPulmonary thromboembolism\n\nTumours/cancer\n\nHead trauma\n\nUrinary tract rupture\n\n 2\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

The normal body temperature for a healthy adult cat should be between 38 and 39.2 ¬∞C. A normal temperature for kittens is lower than this, around 36-38‚ÑÉ.¬†\n\nA fever, high temperature, or pyrexia in your cat can be due to many different causes. These can vary from something mild to very serious, and they can be dangerous if not treated quickly.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if you think your cat has a fever\n\nWe recommend a physical exam as soon as possible.

Fleas can spread indirectly through grass, clothing, footwear, and bedding. They can jump long distances too. Indoor-only pets are also at risk.\nAdult fleas survive by feeding on blood.

Around 1% of all cats and 15% of itchy cats have food allergies. The most common signs of food allergies are itchy skin, ear infections, and stomach upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea.¬†\n\nFood allergies are also called cutaneous adverse food reactions or food hypersensitivity. They cannot be cured but can be managed well, and cats can live a full, happy life. Some cats may need medication to help with severe flare-ups, but most can be managed with a special diet alone.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are food allergies in cats?\n\nThe cause of these allergies is an overreaction of the immune system to a food or ingredient that it has already been exposed to.\n\nAny ingredient, but most commonly the protein source (i.e. chicken, dairy, or fish) can cause a reaction.\nYour cat can be allergic to one or more ingredients in their food.\nA food allergy involves the immune system, whereas a food intolerance does not. Food intolerances are more common and tend to be less severe.\nFood allergies can occur at any age, even if they have been on the same food for years.\nOnce the allergy has developed, it cannot be cured but can be managed to stop or reduce the symptoms.\n\nFood allergies can cause severe symptoms. If you suspect your cat has any allergies, speak to a vet for advice and to form a treatment plan to help improve their health.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of food allergies in cats\n\nIt‚Äôs not always easy to tell if your cat has food allergies. The signs might not be seen daily, can be vague, and are often linked to other allergies.\n\nSkin signs often start around the head, face, and neck and include\n\nItchy skin and overgrooming\nHair loss, red skin, rash, ulcers and plaques\nSwollen lip or chin\n\nSigns can affect other parts of the body too\n\nItchy ears and ear infections\nGastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, soft stools or diarrhoea, hairballs and weight loss\nLethargy\nRespiratory signs such as sneezing, wheezing, rhinitis, or asthma.\n\nFind out more about what else can make your cat itchy\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of food allergies than others?\n\nFood allergies can affect cats of all ages, breeds, and sexes. The following may be more at risk:\n\nBreeds: Siamese and Siamese crosses.\nAge: It can occur at any age but is more common in younger cats (in up to 50% of cases, signs start when they are under 3 years old).\nDamage to the intestinal tract from previous surgery, infection, certain medications or inflammation can increase the risk of food allergies\n\n¬†\n\nHow are food allergies diagnosed in cats?\n\nThe diagnosis of food allergies can be tricky, and it is often a process of elimination. Cats may have other illnesses that are linked, such as environmental allergies (atopy) or flea allergies.\n\nThe following tests can help rule out other conditions:\n\nA thorough physical examination\nSkin scrapes, hair plucks and skin biopsy\nBlood and urine tests\nIntradermal allergy testing\nImaging of the abdomen, such as x-rays or an ultrasound\nStool tests\n\n¬†\n\nElimination diet trial\n\nAn elimination diet trial is used to diagnose food allergies in cats:\n\nOutdoor cats will need to kept indoors throughout the trial.\nA hydrolysed protein diet is used for at least 6‚Äì8 weeks to assess the response.\nNo other food, including treats, supplements or chews, should be fed during the trial.\nNovel protein diets may be used instead. A novel protein is one that your cat has never been exposed to before.\nIf the symptoms resolve during the trial, it indicates a food allergy. A re-introduction challenge to their old food which causes the symptoms to return confirms the diagnosis.\nPartial improvement of the symptoms indicates that there is not only a food allergy but also a concurrent allergy to something else.\nAt the end of the trial, a veterinarian can advise you on the next steps.\n\nMost foods that are used for food trials can be used long-term too.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for food allergies in cats\n\nAllergies in cats can be very complex. A multimodal approach is often needed to treat allergies. This involves using different products, including special food, medications, and supplements, to help control the symptoms.\n\nInitially, your cat may need:\n\nAnti-itch medication, such as steroids, anti-histamines, and Atopica.\nAntibiotics for any skin, ear or gastrointestinal infections\nParasite control for any fleas or mites\nPain relief\n\nOnce under control, most cats with only food allergies can be managed alone with a special diet.\n\nIf the condition is complicated or not responding to treatment, your vet might refer your cat to a skin specialist (Dermatologist).\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with food allergies at home\n\nFeed your cat a complete and balanced diet in the long term, avoiding any known allergens, such as:\n\nHydrolysed protein diets contain proteins that are broken down into tiny pieces to avoid an immune reaction. Hills Z/D is a hydrolysed diet that is clinically proven to reduce symptoms from food allergies and is used for food trials and long-term.\nA novel protein diet contains proteins that your cat has never been exposed to. These are usually the lesser-used sources, such as venison, duck, and insect content. Such as Hills D/D.\nA home-made diet is also possible. Only under direct advice from a veterinary nutritionist; otherwise, it can be unbalanced and lead to deficiencies.\n\nClean their ears regularly:\n\nUse a vet-recommended ear cleaner once every 7-10 days to keep the ears clean and prevent infection. Cleaning the ears out too often can create problems too.\n\nSkin supplements and special shampoos:\n\nSupplements containing omega oils can help reduce itching and support the skin barrier.\nShampoos can protect and soothe irritated skin.\n\nProbiotics for soft stools or diarrhoea:\n\nProbiotics usually come in paste or granules and help soothe the digestive tract as well as replenish the natural bacteria.\n\nIf your cat is very itchy, a buster collar or pet medical suit can prevent self-trauma.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent food allergies in cats\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to prevent food allergies in cats.\n\nIf your cat has any symptoms of itchy skin, ears, or stomach upset, speak to a vet as soon as possible to find and treat the cause.\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching food allergies?\n\nFood allergies in cats do not spread between cats or from cats to humans.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen you should be worried about food allergies in cats\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour cat is constantly itchy\nYour cat has severe vomiting and diarrhoea, especially if there is blood\nYour cat is lethargic and losing weight\n\nCall us and speak to one of our Joii vets if:\n\nYou want to do a diet trial for your cat\nYou have any questions about your cat‚Äôs short or long-term nutrition\nYour cat has mild vomiting or diarrhoea\nYour cat has mildly itchy skin or ears\nYou have any questions about the best skin supplements, shampoos or ear cleaners to use\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Dogs may have other illnesses that are linked, such as environmental allergies (atopy) or flea allergies.\n\nThe following tests can help rule out other conditions:\n\nA thorough physical examination\nSkin scrapes, hair plucks and skin biopsy\nBlood and urine tests\nIntradermal allergy testing\nImaging of the abdomen, such as x-rays or an ultrasound\nStool tests\n\n¬†\n\nElimination diet trials\n\nAn elimination diet trial is used to diagnose food allergies in dogs.\n\nA hydrolysed protein diet is used for at least 6‚Äì8 weeks to assess the response. Hydrolysed diets are made from proteins that are broken down into small pieces to avoid any immune reaction.\nNo other food, including treats, supplements or chews, should be fed during the trial.\nNovel protein diets may be used instead. A novel protein is one that your dog has never been exposed to before.\nIf the symptoms resolve during the trial, it indicates a food allergy. A re-introduction challenge to their old food which causes the symptoms to return confirms the diagnosis.\nPartial improvement of the symptoms indicates that there is not only a food allergy but also a concurrent allergy to something else.\nAt the end of the trial, a veterinarian can advise you on the best food to keep your dog on long-term.\n\nMost foods that are used for food trials can be used long-term too. See our recommendations in the home remedies section for more information. Hyperlink\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for food allergies in dogs\n\nAllergies in dogs can be very complex. A multimodal approach is often needed to treat allergies. This involves using different products, including special food, medications, and supplements, to help control the symptoms.\n\nInitially, your dog may need:\n\nAnti-itch medication, such as steroids, anti-histamines, Cytopoint, and Apoquel.\nAntibiotics for any skin, ear or gastrointestinal infections\nParasite control for any fleas or mites\nPain relief\n\nOnce under control, most dogs with only food allergies can be managed alone with a special diet.\n\nIf the condition is complicated or not responding to treatment, your vet might refer your dog to a skin specialist (Dermatologist).\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with food allergies at home\n\nFeed your dog a complete and balanced diet in the long term, avoiding any known allergens, such as:\n\nHydrolysed protein diets contain proteins that are broken down into tiny pieces to avoid an immune reaction. Hills Z/D is a hydrolysed diet that is clinically proven to reduce symptoms from food allergies and is used for food trials and long-term.\nA novel protein diet contains proteins that your dog has never been exposed to. These are usually the lesser-used sources, such as venison, duck, and insect content. We recommend Hills Derm Complete and Hills D/D. Hills Derm Complete is the world‚Äôs first clinically proven diet that helps reduce symptoms of both food and environmental allergies.\nA home-made diet is also possible. Only under direct advice from a veterinary nutritionist, otherwise, it can be unbalanced and lead to deficiencies.\n\nClean their ears regularly:\n\nUse a vet recommended ear cleaner every 7-10 days to keep the ears clean and prevent infection. Cleaning the ears too often can also create problems.\n\nSkin supplements and special shampoos:\n\nSupplements containing omega oils can help reduce itching and support the skin barrier.\nShampoos can protect and soothe irritated skin.\n\nProbiotics for soft stools or diarrhoea:\n\nProbiotics usually come in paste or granules and help soothe the digestive tract as well as replenish the natural bacteria.\n\nIf your dog is very itchy, a buster collar, pet medical suit, or boots can prevent self-trauma.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent food allergies in dogs\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to prevent food allergies in dogs.\n\nIf your dog has any symptoms of itchy skin, ears, or stomach upset, speak to a vet as soon as possible to find and treat the cause.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen you should be worried about food allergies in dogs\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour dog is constantly itchy\nYour dog has severe vomiting and diarrhoea, especially if there is blood\nYour dog is lethargic and losing weight\n\nCall us and speak to one of our Joii vets if:\n\nYou want to do a diet trial for your dog\nYou have any questions about your dog‚Äôs short or long-term nutrition\nYour dog has mild vomiting or diarrhoea\nYour dog has mildly itchy skin or ears\nYou have any questions about the best skin supplements, shampoos or ear cleaners to use\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Passing hairballs 2-3 times a year is normal, but if it happens more frequently it is not. All adult cats, except for hairless breeds, can get hairballs.\n\nHairballs can also be called furballs and trichobezoars. They can be so common in cats that they‚Äôre almost considered normal. Cats bring them up when hair accumulates in their stomach. Hairballs are easy to manage when they happen occasionally. But frequent hairballs may signal an underlying health problem.\n\n¬†\n\nCauses of hairballs in cats\n\nCats swallow hair when grooming. This hair should pass out in their poo. But if cats eat too much hair or if it can‚Äôt pass through their intestines normally, it builds up in their stomach.\n\nWe may see cats passing hairballs often if they are overgrooming due to:\n\nPain in their tummy or joints\nGastrointestinal problems that cause a delay in passing the hair\nItchy skin and hair loss, due to allergies, fungal infections or parasites, such as fleas and mites\nBehavioural problems, such as stress and anxiety\nEating prey\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of hairballs in cats\n\nThe signs cats show when having problems with hairballs are often confused with respiratory problems. Signs include:\n\nHaving a dry cough that sounds as if they‚Äôve got something stuck in their throat\nGagging or retching\nVomiting and bringing up the hairball, with liquid or undigested food\n\nSigns that a hairball is causing an obstruction or blockage in your cat‚Äôs tummy include:\n\nStopping eating\nVomiting\nStraining to pass poo or having diarrhoea\nLooking tired and sleepy\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk of having problems with hairballs\n\nCats with health conditions and other illnesses that predispose to hairballs.\n\nChronic pain- older cats with arthritis or pancreatitis\nGastrointestinal diseases, such as IBD, megaoesophagus or reflux\nItchy skin and overgrooming ‚Äì cats with allergies, parasites and infections\nBehavioural challenges -stress and compulsive disorders leading to overgrooming\n\nCertain breeds: Long-haired cat breeds\n\nLifestyle factors: Cats who hunt\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosing hairballs in cat\n\nDiagnosis is straightforward when there are hairballs amongst liquid or undigested food in vomit.\n\nBut symptoms can also be confused with respiratory problems, like asthma. This happens when the hairball gets stuck at the back of your cat‚Äôs throat, but they swallow it down again.\n\nBringing up occasional hairballs shouldn‚Äôt be a reason for concern. But if your cat brings up furballs regularly, it is important to have them checked by a vet to find out why.\n\nVet investigation of hairballs includes:\n\nDiscussing all the information you can give about your cat‚Äôs environment and lifestyle\nPerforming a full physical examination\n\nAnd depending on the above:\n\nPerforming skin scrapes or cultures to check for mites or infections\nOffering blood, poo and urine tests\nOffering a behaviour referral\ncarrying out skin scrapes or cultures to check for mites or infections\nPerforming tummy scans and x-rays if an obstruction is suspected\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for hairballs in cats\n\nFor occasional hairballs:\n\nLaxative pastes: increase the movement in the gut and help drag the hairballs out with the poo. These can be used daily for short periods or weekly for maintenance.\nSpecial foods: Hill‚Äôs Science Plan Hairball Indoor Adult Cat is high in fibre and helps reduce hairballs.\n\nFor Hairballs due to other illnesses.\n\nMedication to help with stress and anxiety, alongside a behaviour modification programme, normally provided by a qualified animal behaviourist.\nIdentifying and treating the underlying problem\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat who suffers from hairballs at home\nLaxative pastes: help keep hairballs moving through the intestines and out in poo.\nSpecially formulated foods: high in fibre and easy to digest. These diets help by increasing the movement of food through the gut and dragging the hairballs out in the poo.\nHairball treats\nPumpkin: rich in fibre also, bulks up the poo and helps push out the furballs. It needs to be offered cooked. Not all cats will take to this remedy.\nCoconut oil, butter and fish oil do not help to remove hairballs. This is because they are digested and absorbed within the gut and do not have lubricating properties.\n\n¬†\n\nTips to help prevent hairballs in cats\n\nAll home remedies, if used regularly can help prevent hairballs from causing vomiting. Or at least reduce the frequency of it happening.\n\nAdditionally, you can try:\n\nBrushing your cat regularly: removing loose hairs and mats, and keeping the coat clean and healthy will reduce the amount of hair your cat swallows\nOffering a skin supplement: this will keep the skin healthier and less prone to itching\nKeeping up to date with flea, tick and mite treatment ‚Äì¬† a product from your vet is recommended\nKeeping your cat hydrated by encouraging them to drink using a water fountain or offering wet food\nCat grass: a special blend of seeds (barley, wheat, rye) that is cat safe and friendly.

It occurs when your cat‚Äôs internal body temperature is higher than normal. It is less common in cats compared to dogs, but they are still at risk.¬†\n\nHeat stroke requires immediate attention, or it can be fatal. If symptoms develop, remove your cat from the heat or sun, start cooling down, and contact your local vet. The most common cause is due to overheating during play or exercise.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat has heat stroke\n\nAct calmly and quickly. With heat stroke, the faster the treatment, the more likely a full recovery is.\n\nStop any exercise and move immediately into a shaded and cool area.\nTry to keep your cat as relaxed as possible, stress can worsen the problem.\nAllow access to cool fresh water for drinking.\nApply or spray cool water (tap water around 15-16‚ÑÉ) slowly on the body. Especially the tummy and inner thighs. You can use a cloth or towel to do this but do not leave the cloth on the body. Avoid the nose and mouth area.\nUse a fan to cool or open all the windows to create a breeze.\n\nGet your cat to your nearest vet practice as soon as possible. Make sure to use the air conditioning in the car or open all the windows.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is heat stroke in cats?\n\nHeat stroke can also be known as hyperthermia, sunstroke, or heat-related illness.\n\nNormal body temperature for cats should be between 38 and 39.2‚ÑÉ (101-102.5‚Ñâ). Heat stroke symptoms usually occur above 40‚ÑÉ.\nThe most common cause is due to overheating during play or exercise.\nIt can also be caused by sitting in the sun or heat for too long. This can be outdoors, inside a vehicle, or in a building.\nWe mostly see this problem during the warm summer months, but it can happen at any time of the year.\nHeat stroke can affect cats of all ages, genders, and breeds. Brachycephalic (short-snouted) cats are much more likely to suffer from the condition.\nBrachycephalic cats are more at risk of heat stroke\n\n¬†\n\nCats are different from humans in the way they cool themselves down. Instead of having sweat glands all over the body, they can only sweat through the paw pads. They cool down by cleaning themselves, shedding, and stretching out in cool areas. Panting can help cool the body down, but this can also be one of the first symptoms we see with heat stroke.\n\nA rise in the body temperature can lead to serious damage to the internal organs.

It requires immediate attention, or it can be fatal. Remove your dog from the heat or sun¬†if symptoms develop and contact your local vet.\n\nThe most common cause of heat stroke in dogs is overheating during play or exercise. It can also be due to sitting in the sun or heat for too long. This can be inside a vehicle or building as well as outdoors.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your dog has heat stroke\n\nWhat to do at home if your dog starts showing symptoms of heat stroke.\n\nAct calmly but quickly. The quicker the treatment, the more likely a full recovery is.\n\nStop any exercise and move your pet immediately into a shaded and cool area.\nAllow access to cool, fresh water for drinking.\nAvoid placing wet cloths or towels on their body, as these can trap heat and make the problem worse.\nPour cool (not freezing) water on the body, especially the tummy and inner thighs. Tap water around 15-16‚ÑÉ is best.¬†Do this slowly and avoid the nose and mouth areas.\nIf possible, use a fan or open all the windows to create a breeze.\n\nTransport your pet to your nearest vet practice as soon as possible. Make sure to use air conditioning in the car if possible or open all the windows.\n\nWhat causes heat stroke in dogs?\n\nHeat stroke occurs when your dog‚Äôs internal body temperature is much higher than normal.\n\nHeat stroke is also known as hyperthermia, sunstroke, or heat-related illness.\nNormal body temperature for dogs should be between 38 and 39‚ÑÉ (101-102.5‚Ñâ). Heat stroke symptoms usually occur above 40‚ÑÉ.\nHeat stroke can affect dogs of all ages, genders, and breeds. Brachycephalic (short-snouted) dogs are twice as likely to suffer from the condition.\nWe see this problem most often during the warm summer months, but it can happen at any time of the year.\nDogs are different from humans in the way they cool themselves down. They can only sweat through the non-haired skin on the nose and paws. They can also cool themselves down by panting, but sometimes this is not enough.\nRises in the body temperature can lead to serious damage to the internal organs. This can result in internal bleeding, coma, and death.\nImmediate treatment is vital!

Cats with hip dysplasia can develop secondary osteoarthritis¬†of the affected joint. Maine Coon, Persian, and Himalayan breeds are more likely to develop hip dysplasia, although it can affect any cat.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHip dysplasia is caused by abnormal development of the hip while the cat is growing. Signs of hip dysplasia in cats are often gradual, making them difficult\n\nto spot. The start of signs can vary between 3 months and 3.5 years of age.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hip dysplasia in cats?\n\nThe hips are ‚Äúball and socket‚Äù joints, which normally fit together perfectly to allow easy movement.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia in cats is an inherited problem that is not well understood by the scientific community.\n\nThe socket (acetabulum) of the hip commonly appears shallowed, resulting in the loosening of the hip joint, which causes dysfunction and pain.\n\nAs the cat grows, the cartilage and bone of the hip begin to wear down. Over time, this disease leads to arthritis¬†of the affected joint, muscle loss, and limited mobility.\n\nIn the short term, most cats with hip dysplasia will make an improvement when they are managed appropriately.\n\nLong-term improvements are not always as successful.\n\nThe majority of cats in later life will have ongoing exercise restrictions and require medications.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to identify the signs of hip dysplasia in cats¬†\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your cat:¬†\n\nLess active\nLimping that is worse after exercise\nDifficulty climbing\nReluctance to jump\nInability or reluctance to climb stairs\nWalking in a crouched position\nHowling while resting\nReluctance to squat to poop\n\nThe onset of signs of disease is variable, starting between 3 months and 3.5 years of age.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of hip dysplasia than others?\n\nGenetics is the main risk factor for this condition.¬†\n\nMaine Coon, Persian, and Himalayan breeds tend to be more likely to develop hip dysplasia, although it can affect any cat.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow to diagnose hip dysplasia in cats\n\nTo help determine whether your cat has hip dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your cat‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination¬†\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\nEvaluate how loose the hip joint is by manipulating it under sedation or general anaesthesia\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat hip dysplasia in cats\n\nTreatment for hip dysplasia depends on many factors, but the most important is the severity of the condition.¬†\n\nYour vet might recommend one or more of the following treatment options:\n\nWeight management\nPrescription medications\nSupplements¬†\nAlternative therapies\nIntra articular interventions\nControlled exercise in acute episodes\nSurgery\nWeight management¬†\n\nIt is important that your cat is kept at an ideal body condition score of 4-5/9 to prevent excessive weight on their joints.

Dogs with hip dysplasia develop secondary osteoarthritis of the affected joint. Large-breed dogs are more likely to develop this condition, although it can affect dogs of any size or breed.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia may be associated with hip joint laxity and hip subluxation.¬† This disease is caused by abnormal development of the hip while the dog is growing. A system has been implemented to check for hip dysplasia before breeding dogs. This reduces the number of puppies born with this painful condition.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hip dysplasia in dogs?\n\nThe hips are ‚Äúball and socket‚Äù joints, which normally fit together perfectly to allow easy movement.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia is an inherited problem where there‚Äôs a tendency to develop loose hips early in life, resulting in dysfunction and pain.\n\nThis abnormal development of the hips can be caused by genetics, nutrition and hormones.¬†\n\nAs the dog grows, the cartilage and bones of the hip begin to wear down. Over time, this causes arthritis, muscle loss, and limited mobility.\n\nIn the short term, most dogs with hip dysplasia will improve when they‚Äôre managed properly.\n\nLong-term improvements aren‚Äôt always as successful.\n\nIt is common for dogs to live to an old age with exercise restrictions and medication.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to identify the signs of hip dysplasia in dogs¬†\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your dog:¬†\n\nLimping on one or both of the hind limbs¬†\nBunny-hopping: running/walking with both back legs moving together\nA swaying walk\nDifficulty jumping or walking upstairs¬†\nStiffness or limping after exercise¬†\nDifficulty rising after periods of rest\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of hip dysplasia than others?\n\nHip dysplasia can occur in any size dog.\n\nLarge-breed dogs: are more prone, such as German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Alaskan Malamutes, Newfoundland, Old English Sheepdogs, Rottweilers, Saint Bernards, and Samoyeds.\n\nNutrition: large-breed puppies with excessive calcium in their food. Puppies that grow too quickly or become obese due to inappropriate feeding.\n\nHormones: there is some evidence that puppies that are neutered while their bones are still growing may be more likely to develop hip dysplasia.\n\nExcessive exercise during puppyhood does not necessarily contribute to the development of hip dysplasia.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow to diagnose hip dysplasia in dogs\n\nHip dysplasia is usually diagnosed between 6 and 12 months of age.\n\nTo help determine whether your dog has hip dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your dog‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination¬†\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\nEvaluate the hip laxity by manipulating the joint under sedation or under general anaesthesia\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat hip dysplasia in dogs\n\nTreatment for hip dysplasia depends on many factors, but the most important is the severity of the condition.¬† Your vet might recommend one or more of the following treatment options:\n\nWeight Management\nPrescription Medications\nSupplements¬†\nComplementary/Alternative Therapies\nIntra Articular Interventions\nControlled Exercise In Acute Onsets\nSurgery\nWeight management¬†\n\nIt is important that your dog is kept at an ideal body condition score of 4-5 to prevent excessive weight on their joints.

and genetic control tests.\n\nRegular vet health checks\n\nFor early diagnosis and to help monitor any relevant changes.¬†\n\nPuppies at high risk of hip dysplasia need to be closely monitored in the first 5 months of life.\n\nTo determine how healthy your dog‚Äôs hip joints are, there are several tests we can do:\n\nhands-on examination tests under sedation or general anaesthesia¬†\nradiographic studies with specific scoring systems\nWeight control\n\nAs your dog grows, providing them with appropriate exercise and a healthy diet will help prevent obesity, one of the major contributing factors to hip dysplasia.\n\nGiving the correct food and quantity for the age and stage of development of your dog is vital.¬†\n\nDiet And Nutrition\n\nFeeding your puppy an appropriate age and breed diet will give them a head start on healthy bone and joint development and help prevent the excessive growth that leads to the disease.\n\nExercise Caution\n\nStaying fit and exercising regularly will help your dog‚Äôs muscles stay strong and reduce joint stress.\n\nDogs with hip dysplasia should never be exercised to the point of fatigue.¬†\n\nAvoid high impact, sharp starts or stops, twisting, and repetitive movements such as ball throwing for prolonged periods.\n\nNeutering guidance\n\nIf you plan to neuter your dog, do so with guidance regarding the most appropriate age for their breed. Early neutering can increase the risk of hip dysplasia.\n\nAs the disease is hereditary, it is recommended not to breed a pet that has hip dysplasia.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry if your dog has hip dysplasia\n\nCall a vet if your dog shows any of these signs or if you have any concerns:\n\nNot improving or worsening despite treatment¬†\nSudden and dramatic worsening of stiffness or limping¬†\nLoss of appetite\nVomiting or diarrhoea, especially if taking medications¬†\nIncreased drinking or urination¬†\n\nPain can also appear in more subtle ways over a longer period of time, such as over weeks or months (chronic pain).

It‚Äôs a common cause of illness in middle-aged to older cats. Around 1 in 10 cats of any breed or sex will develop hyperthyroidism. If the condition is effectively managed, they can go on to enjoy a good quality of life for years.¬†\n\nHyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid glands become overactive. The most common cause is a harmless growth of one or both thyroid glands. Early warning signs include weight loss, despite eating well and changes in behaviour. There are multiple treatment options available. In over 95% of cases, hyperthyroidism can be treated medically or even cured. So the outlook is good for most treated cats.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hyperthyroidism in cats?\n\nHyperthyroidism means there‚Äôs too much of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine, in your cat‚Äôs system. Thyroxine controls metabolic rate or how quickly the body burns up energy.\n\nYour cat has 2 small thyroid glands in their neck. Over 95% of hyperthyroidism cases result from a growth on a thyroid gland. This growth is usually benign, meaning it doesn‚Äôt spread to other parts of the body. But it produces extra thyroid hormone. And thyroid hormone has profound effects on your cat‚Äôs metabolism. Think of metabolism as a car‚Äôs acceleration. Hyperthyroidism is like having the accelerator pedal pressed down and stuck to the floor! Everything ‚Äòspeeds up‚Äô uncontrollably and the engine burns through much more fuel (food and oxygen). Eventually, various ‚Äòengine components‚Äô (organs) will become damaged and stop working. And the ‚Äòengine‚Äô starts to fail. Inside your cat‚Äôs body, this means:\n\nIncreasing nutritional (food) requirements to fuel increased metabolism\nIncreasing heart rate and thickening heart muscle\nIncreasing blood pressure\nDamage to kidneys and intestine\n\nHyperthyroidism is a serious illness, but a range of options exist for management and treatment.\n\nAround 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism result from cancer of the thyroid gland. Outlook is more uncertain for this group, although treatment options are available.\n\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?\n\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism relate to increased metabolism, including the increased demand for fuel and the damage to vital organs.\n\nLosing weight despite eating more\nVomiting and diarrhoea\nDrinking more and peeing more\nBecoming hyperactive, restless and/or more vocal\nDeveloping a dull, staring coat\nIncreasing heart rate\nBreathing difficulties\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of hyperthyroidism?\n\nCats over 10 years old are most likely to develop hyperthyroidism.\n\nAll breeds and sexes are equally at risk.\n\n¬†\n\nAre my family or other pets at risk of hyperthyroidism\n\nHyperthyroidism affects individual cats. Your family and other pets are not at risk of getting hyperthyroidism.¬†\n\nHowever, medicine that suppresses your cat‚Äôs thyroid hormone levels can have the same effect on humans.\n\nMedicine for hyperthyroidism must be handled carefully, especially by women of childbearing age\nWash your hands carefully after handling tablets\nClean surfaces thoroughly after any contact\nKeep all medicines out of sight and reach of children and pets.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose hyperthyroidism\n\nVets diagnose hyperthyroidism based on the following:\n\nThe ‚Äòhistory‚Äô: any changes you report, eg losing weight, hyperactivity, vomiting etc\nPhysical examination: sometimes vets can feel an enlarged thyroid gland in your cat‚Äôs neck. This is called a goitre.\nBlood tests: general check and thyroid hormone level\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for hyperthyroidism?\n\nFour treatment options are available:\n\nAnti-thyroid medicines\nAnti-thyroid diet\nSurgery\nRadioactive iodine injection\n\nThe choice for your cat depends on the severity of their symptoms and the practical considerations.\n\nPracticalities include:\n\nWill your cat take medicine?\n\nWill your cat take tablets?\nDoes your lifestyle permit giving your cat medicine regularly?\nDoes your cat have other health conditions, likely to be complicated by more medicines, anaesthetics or hospital stays?\nDoes your cat go outdoors or hunt and do you have more than one cat?\n\nWhere you live¬†\n\nAre you close to a clinic that offers surgery or radioactive iodine treatment?\nIf not, does your cat travel well?\nDo you have transport?\n\nCost of treatment¬†\n\nCosts will vary depending on the options, the area you live and where you buy medication or special diets.\n\nVariable costs for complications include:\n\nSide effects like vomiting and diarrhoea\nAnaesthetic reactions or post-surgery complications, including wound infections, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism (low blood calcium), repeat surgery for a second or subsequent growth\nHospital stays for longer than quoted\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with hyperthyroidism at home\n\nThere are no home remedies for cats with hyperthyroidism. But home support is essential to ensure your cat gets the most benefit from their vet treatment.\n\nGive thyroid medicine as prescribed at the correct dose and time\nMake sure your cat¬† takes their medication (no spitting it out behind the sofa!)\nAsk for help or alternatives if you are struggling to give tablets\nCheck your cat‚Äôs weight regularly. Weight loss can be the first warning sign that treatment needs reviewed\nTake your cat for regular vet checks and keep on top of preventive care, like worming and vaccinations\nUnless your cat is on Y/D prescription food, feed a diet which provides lots of calories (energy), enough fat and high-quality protein such as chicken, rabbit or fish\n\n¬†\n\nCan hyperthyroidism be prevented?\n\nHyperthyroidism can‚Äôt be prevented. But it can be controlled for long periods. It can even be cured with radioactive Iodine treatment\n\nIt‚Äôs not always easy to notice gradual changes in your cat‚Äôs weight and body condition when you see them every day.\n\nWeigh your cat¬† regularly as they get older; every 1-3 months\nWeight Loss is an excellent early warning for ill health in cats\nSeek vet advice promptly if you do notice changes in your cat‚Äôs eating or drinking habits or behaviour\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about cats with hyperthyroidism\n\nSevere or untreated hyperthyroidism leads to organ failure and death. Vital organs such as the liver and kidneys are susceptible. But high blood pressure can also damage the eyes and brain.\n\nWarning signs of worsening thyroid illness include:\n\nPersistent vomiting or diarrhoea\nWeakness and collapse\nBreathing difficulties- fast shallow breathing, open-mouthed breathing\nLethargy (tiredness)\nGoing suddenly blind\nConfusion, pacing, head-pressing\nFits or seizures\n\nCall your nearest vet if your cat is having seizures or suddenly seems blind\n\nThyroid treatment and kidney disease\n\nUntreated hyperthyroidism will cause kidney damage.\n\nBut older cats are also at higher risk of kidney disease for other reasons.¬†And symptoms of kidney disease may only start to show up after your cat starts antithyroid treatment. This happens because of the following:\n\nHyperthyroidism causes increased blood pressure\nHigher blood pressure in untreated cats pushes blood into the kidneys\nAs blood pressure falls in treated cats, the kidneys have less effective blood flow.\nKidney impairment which was compensated by better blood flow may rapidly worsen\nWorsening kidney function complicates longer-term recovery and may make some treatments unsuitable.\n\nAssess quality of life\n\n¬†\n\nJoii can help with:\nRecognising symptoms of hyperthyroidism\nChoosing and keeping to the right diet for your cat\nGiving medication\nChoosing the treatment option best for you and your cat\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This is a common problem for very senior cats.\n\n¬†\n\nThere are many possible causes for bowel incontinence. Some cats pass stools without knowing and others have some awareness but things no longer flow properly. In older cats there can be a combination of problems and an association with dementia. In younger cats, incontinence is usually due to injury or nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is incontinent\n\nIf your cat becomes incontinent suddenly, speak to a vet right away. This is especially important if they are also showing signs of pain or having trouble moving. They may have suffered nerve or spinal damage.\n\nIf the problem is intermittent or has developed slowly over time, a vet check is still important to rule out serious disease.\n\nCheck your pet frequently and remove any soiling as soon as possible to avoid skin problems and secondary infections.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of bowel incontinence in cats\n\nIf the anus loses its strength, poo will come out without the cat realising it.\n\nCats may also attempt to pass stools but the process may be difficult or abnormal, with faeces sometimes coming out after they leave the tray.\n\nSome common causes are:\n\nTail pull injury: the nerves at the end of the spine are stretched and lose function. This may be temporary or permanent.\nTraumatic spinal injury: damage to the spine from an accident or attack.\nSphincter incontinence: the muscles and nerves keeping the anus closed stop working properly.\nCognitive dysfunction or Dementia: the brain is no longer monitoring or controlling the passage of poo.\nTumour\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about bowel incontinence in cats\n\nSudden incontinence is usually due to a serious injury or disease. See a vet right away.\n\nProgressive incontinence in older cats may be connected to other diseases, such as tumours. A vet check is recommended.\n\nA cat that consciously passes poo in specific places outside their tray has a different type of problem, possibly related to stress or an issue they have with the tray. A vet will be able to provide further advice on this.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to prevent bowel incontinence in cats\n\nA healthy and balanced diet will keep the gut regular and functioning well, which may help prevent some causes of incontinence.\n\nRegular exercise and play have the same benefits.\n\nTreating and managing mobility problems like arthritis may have a positive impact on gut function as well.\n\nNeutering a cat reduces how far they roam, fighting, and other behaviours that put them at risk for injury.\n\n¬†\n\nThings to look out for if your cat has bowel incontinence\nPassing poo while walking, playing or resting\nSoiling on back legs or tail\nStraining in tray without passing anything and poo on the floor\n\n¬†\n\nHome remedies for bowel incontinence in cats\nTreating bowel incontinence is difficult and often not effective. It is important to check if there is a hidden cause.\nMake litter tray access easier, by providing more trays around the house or choosing ones that are easier to get into.\nChange diet to reduce the amount of poo produced while still keeping the right amounts of all nutrients.\nIf associated with dementia, treatments for this may help.\nCheck their skin and coat for soiling frequently. Keeping them clean is important to avoid complications.\nKeep bedding clean and dry.\n\nBowel incontinence is often associated with other problems that seriously impact the quality of life. If you are struggling to manage this problem or it is causing important complications, euthanasia may be the kindest option. Don‚Äôt hesitate to speak to a vet if you have concerns about this.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for bowel incontinence in cats\n\nA thorough physical and neurological examination (testing reflexes and muscle tone) will provide a lot of information.\n\nX-rays are often used to check the amount and type of faeces present in the gut, as well as any bone or joint abnormalities\nUltrasound may be used if masses are suspected but is not always useful\nComplex cases may require MRI or endoscopy.\n\nTreating incontinence caused by spinal or nerve damage is difficult.\n\nPain relief is crucial, and anti-inflammatories may help.\n\nBone fractures may need to be stabilised.\n\nSphincter incontinence has no specific treatment and can only be managed. If advanced or severe, euthanasia may be discussed.\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk of bowel incontinence\n\nRoaming cats are at higher risk for injuries that lead to bowel incontinence.\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of bowel incontinence in cats\nInfections or masses around the anus\nConditions that affect¬† nerve and muscle function, such as peripheral neuropathies\nFibrocartilaginous Thromboembolism: a blood clot, often in the blood vessels going to the spine or back end\nParasites in the brain or spinal cord, such as Toxoplasmosis\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

It is important to check if there is a hidden cause.\nIncreasing the frequency of walks can help.\nDietary changes to reduce the amount of poo produced while still keeping the right amounts of all nutrients may also help\nIf associated with dementia, treatments for this may help.\nChecking frequently for soiling of their coat and keeping them clean is important to avoid complications.\nKeep bedding and blankets clean and dry.\n\nBowel incontinence is often associated with other problems that seriously impact the quality of life. If you are struggling to manage this problem or if it‚Äôs causing important complications, euthanasia may be the kindest option. Don‚Äôt hesitate to speak to a vet if you have concerns about this.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for bowel incontinence in dogs\n\nA thorough physical and neurological examination (testing reflexes and muscle tone) will provide a lot of information.\n\nX-rays are often used to check the amount and type of faeces present in the gut, as well as any bone or joint abnormalities\nUltrasound may be used if masses are suspected but is not always useful\nComplex cases may require MRI or endoscopy.\n\nTreating incontinence caused by spinal or nerve damage is difficult.\n\nPain relief is crucial, and anti-inflammatories may help.\n\nSome types of spinal disease require surgery as soon as possible.\n\nSphincter incontinence has no specific treatment and can only be managed.

There are many different problems that may cause your cat to itch.¬†\n\nSome conditions are more common in different breeds or at different ages. Depending on the cause and condition, cats may need lifelong treatment. If your cat becomes itchy, consult a vet for advice as soon as possible. If left untreated, itching can worsen and lead to severe self-trauma, hair loss, and skin infections.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is itchy\n\nDepending on how severe the signs are, different treatment options may be available.\n\nMild itching is when the itch does not happen often. This can often be treated at home, depending on the cause. Skin supplements, diet changes, parasite control, and topical skin treatments can all be useful. Speak to our Joii vets for more information.\nWhen your cat is constantly scratching, we describe this as moderate or severe itching. They will stop what they are doing, such as eating or sleeping, to itch themselves. This often requires prescription medication to resolve the symptoms. Contact your local veterinarian for an appointment as soon as possible.\n\nThe most common causes of itching in cats\n\nThere are many different things that can cause your cat to itch. Click on the links to explore each cause in more detail.\n\nAllergies\n\nAllergies are the most common cause of itching in cats and can be split into different categories\n\nFlea allergy dermatitis: an infection of the skin caused by flea bites.\nFood allergies: an allergy to something in the food. Usually the protein source, such as chicken or beef.\nA contact allergic reaction: sudden in appearance and often seen as bumps all over the skin, usually starting around the face. Also known as urticaria, or hives.\nFeline atopic skin syndrome: a type of skin allergy usually caused by environmental allergies such as pollen, dust mites, or smoke.\nParasites\nFleas: are the most common cause of itching in cats. Indoor cats can get fleas too.\nMites: Demodex and Sarcoptes (mange), ear mites, harvest mites\nSkin infections\n\nThese are often secondary to allergies or parasites.\n\nBacterial, yeast, or fungal\nEar disease: most often related to allergies. Can also be due to foreign bodies, ear mites, or masses in the ear.\nRingworm\nOthers\nPain: often when it involves a specific area. Can cause cats to chew or bite at an area of skin. Includes acute pain, such as wounds, and long-term pain, such as arthritis.\nWounds¬†or injuries: such as cat bite abscesses.\nStress: a common cause of overgrooming, often caused by a change in your cat‚Äôs environment or routine.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about your itchy cat\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour cat is constantly itching throughout the day.\nYour cat develops any severe skin lesions, or they are widespread over the body.\nYour cat is unwell as well as itchy.\nYour cat has a sudden allergic reaction with breathing problems.\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYour cat has a mild itch or has started scratching their ears.\nYour cat has small or localised skin issues.\nYou have questions about what skin supplements or ear cleaners are best to use.\nYou have questions about the best parasite control for cats.\nYou have any questions about food allergies or how to do diet trials.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent your cat from itching\nUse regular parasite control that covers fleas, mites, ticks, and worms.\nRegularly clean your cat‚Äôs bedding, collar, and bowls.\nDust and vacuum the house often, and avoid sprays or perfumes in the house.\nBrush your cat regularly and check for any abnormal areas of skin.\nFeed your cat high-quality, complete food for their age and lifestyle.

Most often it is due to spinal or tail injuries.\n\nIncontinence is when urine is passed without control.¬† Controlling the passage of urine requires a combination of voluntary actions and involuntary reflexes. Voluntary control can be affected by serious damage to any part of the spine. Reflexes can be affected by damage to nerves near the base of the tail. If the bladder is very distended it can lead to overflow and leakage. All of these problems are very serious and a vet check is urgently needed.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is leaking urine\n\nSee a vet straight away if:\n\nan adult cat is leaking urine\nthey appear to be in pain or are not acting normal.\n\nHandle them gently and carefully, as they may be injured.

It is more common in middle-aged neutered females and usually responds well to treatment. Puppies can have a rare and more serious type of incontinence.\n\nThe most common cause is urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence, where the urethra becomes too weak to stop urine from dripping out of the bladder. In puppies, incontinence is often due to a birth defect called ectopic ureter. Urinary incontinence can also be caused by spinal disease or other nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence in dogs\nWhy is my dog leaking urine?\n\nUrinary incontinence is when urine leaks out without the dog realising it. This usually happens when they are lying down or resting.\n\nIn puppies with ectopic ureter, the urine coming from the kidneys is deposited beyond the bladder, which prevents normal storage and control.\n\nIn adult dogs the muscles controlling the exit to the bladder weaken over time and the position of the bladder may change.\n\nIn neutered animals, hormonal changes play a significant role in the development of incontinence.\n\nIncontinence from spinal or nerve problems usually happens together with other symptoms, such as pain and trouble moving.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence in dogs¬†\n\nSpots or puddles of urine on their bed or where they rest\n\nArea around vulva or penis may be wet\n\nPuppies may dribble urine when standing and moving¬†\n\nSymptoms in puppies may not start until they are fully grown\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of urinary incontinence than others?\n\nThe majority of dogs affected by this condition are neutered females\n\nLarge breeds are more commonly affected, particularly Irish Setters and Boxers\n\nIn puppies, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more commonly affected\n\n¬†\n\nHow is urinary incontinence diagnosed in dogs?\n\nEctopic ureters in puppies can be difficult to diagnose. If size permits, cystoscopy may be ideal. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed through the urethra so the inside can be checked.\n\nOther options include an ultrasound scan, a special type of x-ray or a CT scan.\n\nIn adult dogs, urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence is usually diagnosed by ruling out other causes of incontinence.\n\nA urine test is recommended in all cases to rule out infection and disease in other organs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for urinary incontinence in dogs?\n\nIn puppies, the abnormal urine path must be closed. In many cases, this can be done during cystoscopy. If not, surgery is required.\n\nIn adult dogs, there are medications to improve bladder control. These tend to work well in females but not so much in males.\n\nSome medications, like phenylpropanolamine (Propalin), directly improve the strength of the muscles around the bladder exit.\n\nOther medications, like estriol (Incurin), replace the effects of oestrogen on the urethral muscle.\n\nThese two types of medications can be used together, and this is thought to have additional benefits.\n\nIf not responding to medication, there are surgical procedures that will reduce urine losses by re-positioning the bladder slightly (colposuspension).\n\nIt is also possible to insert an artificial urethral sphincter to control urine flow or inject material into the urethral wall to increase tension.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with urinary incontinence\n\nUrine can be very irritant to the skin.

Cats of any age, breed, or sex can be affected. Acute kidney failure usually develops within a matter of days and symptoms become very serious very quickly.\n\nAcute kidney failure (injury) happens when the kidneys suffer damage and stop working. This leads to a build-up of fluid and toxic waste inside the body. Acute kidney failure can sometimes¬†be reversed¬†with rapid and intensive vet care. But it‚Äôs a life-threatening illness and around 50% of cats who develop acute kidney failure won‚Äôt survive. Cats who do recover may develop long-term health problems, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). The sooner acute kidney failure¬†is recognised¬†and treated, the better the chances of long-term recovery.\n\nWhat is acute kidney failure in cats?\n\nThe kidneys are two essential organs in your cat‚Äôs abdomen. Their functions include:\n\nControlling fluid and salt levels in the body\nRemoving toxins and waste from the blood\nProducing some hormones.\n\nWhen the kidneys stop working, the body can‚Äôt control fluid and salt levels. All the organs and tissues which depend on this control also stop working. This includes the heart, muscles and brain. The damage gets worse as harmful waste products continue to accumulate.\n\n¬†\n\nCauses of Acute Kidney Failure\n\n¬†\n\nPoisons\nChemicals- antifreeze, cleaning products, batteries, insecticides, paint\nPlants- lilies, bulbs\nSome Foods- raisins, chocolate\nAnti-parasite treatments\nCertain medicines ‚Äì some¬†painkillers, antibiotics and antifungal drugs\n\n¬†\n\nInfection\nViral infections (FIP, FeLV, FIV)\nSevere or recurrent kidney infections (pyelonephritis)\nParasite infections- toxoplasmosis\n\n¬†\n\nReduced blood flow\n\nIt deprives the kidneys of vital oxygen from red blood cells\n\nTrauma (road accidents)\nShock (sepsis, organ failure)\nHeart failure (cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure)\nSevere dehydration\n\n¬†\n\nBack pressure\n\nDamage to kidney tissue when urine can‚Äôt flow from the kidneys to the bladder and out of the body\n\nBlocked bladder.\nCrystals or stones blocking the kidneys or the ureters\n\nKidneys produce urine, which passes to the bladder through small tubes called ureters. Urine leaves the bladder (and the body) through another wider tube, called the urethra. If urine can‚Äôt escape out of the bladder, fluid builds up inside the kidneys, making them swell. This causes buildup of pressure inside the kidneys. If not treated early, the resulting damage to kidney structure can lead to kidney failure.\n\n¬†\n\nCancer\n\nIt may begin in the kidneys themselves or spread there from other parts of the body.\n\nSymptoms of acute kidney failure in cats\n\nSymptoms of acute kidney failure in cats will often overlap those of other serious illnesses.\n\nNot eating\nVomiting and diarrhoea, possibly with blood\nLethargy and weakness\nSevere halitosis (bad breath)\nMouth ulcers and drooling saliva\nGoing blind suddenly\nCollapse and seizures\n\nFind your nearest vet if your cat is collapsed, having seizures, or has been vomiting blood.\n\nCats at higher risk of developing acute kidney failure\n\nSome cats will have more risk of developing acute kidney failure, depending on their lifestyle and general health.\n\n¬†\n\nOutdoor cats\n\nThey are more likely to encounter antifreeze (ethylene glycol), and poisonous plants in gardens.\n\n¬†\n\nOlder cats\n\nOlder cats are more likely to have other illnesses and age-related changes which predispose them to acute kidney failure. They may already suffer from chronic kidney disease.\n\n¬†\n\nCats with other illnesses\n\nIllnesses which affect the blood supply and health of the kidneys. For example:\n\nChronic kidney disease\nOveractive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\nPancreatitis\nHeart disease\nCats with urinary tract disease (FLUTD), especially overweight indoor male cats\nKidney and bladder stones (urolithiasis)\n\n¬†\n\nCertain breeds\n\nBreeds can have inherited problems that weaken their kidneys. This makes them prone to chronic kidney disease and then acute kidney disease. This is known as acute-on-chronic kidney disease.\n\nPersian-¬†¬†(polycystic kidney disease, PKD)\nSiamese and Abyssinian-¬†(renal amyloidosis)\n\nCats receiving certain medication.¬†All medicines can have side effects. Some can damage your cat‚Äôs kidneys. This may happen even without taking more than the recommended dose\n\nPainkillers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nCertain antibiotics\nAntifungal treatments\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching acute kidney failure?\n\nAcute kidney failure is not in itself a risk to humans or to other pets.\n\nViruses which cause kidney disease may spread between cats who live together. For example:\n\nFIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis)\nFelv (Feline Leukaemia Virus)\nFiv (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of acute kidney failure in cats\n\nVets diagnose acute kidney failure from the following checks and tests:\n\nSymptoms\nHistory\nBlood tests to check for levels of important proteins, chemicals and electrolytes (salts) in the blood\nUrine test ‚Äì analysis and bacterial culture\nBlood pressure check\nUltrasound Scan\nX-rays\n\nVet treatment for acute kidney failure\n\nAcute kidney failure is a life-threatening condition that needs intensive care at a vet clinic or hospital.\n\n¬†\n\nIntensive vet care\nFluids directly into your cat‚Äôs veins to flush the kidneys\nPain relief and Antibiotics to control infection\nRebalancing electrolytes (salts) in the body\nProtecting stomach and intestines from acid and toxin damage (gastrointestinal protectants)\nControlling blood pressure\nMedicine to start the kidneys making urine again\nTreating the underlying cause of the kidney failure if possible\nReplacing essential vitamins\n\n¬†\n\nSpecialist treatments\nKidney dialysis ‚Äì aims to keep cats with acute kidney failure stable while the kidneys recover.

It‚Äôs only appropriate if the underlying cause has been found and is curable.\nKidney transplants?¬† Kidney transplants for cats happen in some countries. There are welfare and ethical concerns for both the donor cat and the sick cat. Kidney Transplants are banned in the UK. A kidney transplant wouldn‚Äôt help a cat with acute kidney failure. The disease develops suddenly and there‚Äôs widespread damage to other organs.\n\nHow to look after a cat with acute kidney disease at home\n\nThere are no home remedies. Acute kidney failure needs intensive treatment at a vet clinic.\n\nCats who recover need ongoing care at home and regular check-ups with a vet.\n\nKeep your cat indoors during recovery\nGive prescribed medicines at the right time and dose\nEncourage your cat to drink lots ‚Äì provide a water fountain and add water to food\nFeed your cat a special¬†prescription diet¬†recommended for kidney disease\nEncourage your cat to eat ‚Äì warm up food or add in salt-free stock\nGive recommended vitamin supplements\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with acute kidney failure\n\nCats who survive the early stages of acute kidney failure need ongoing treatment at home.

Kidney disease may be chronic (comes on gradually) or acute (sudden).\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common illnesses affecting cats. Cats of any age, sex or breed may develop chronic kidney disease, but it‚Äôs most common in older cats. Around 30% of all cats over 10 years old (of any breed) have chronic kidney disease, rising to 50% of cats over 15 years old. Younger cats who get chronic kidney disease are more likely to belong to certain breeds, including Maine Coon, Ragdoll and Siamese.\n\nKidneys carry out essential functions in the body. As cats get older, their kidneys become less efficient. The reason why this happens isn‚Äôt known. There are triggers which can make it happen earlier or progress quicker. These include toxins, infections and other illnesses. There‚Äôs no cure for Chronic Kidney Disease.¬†Eventually, the kidneys will fail completely. But the rate of deterioration varies between cats. Symptoms of CKD can often¬†be stabilised¬†for prolonged periods. Early diagnosis and treatment help achieve the best outcome for the longest time.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease in cats?¬†\n\nChronic kidney disease means your cat‚Äôs kidneys have suffered damage over a long time. The damage can‚Äôt be reversed or cured.\n\nWe often don‚Äôt know how the kidneys get damaged. Ageing change is part of the cause, but other factors can include:\n\nExposure to toxins; anti-freeze, grapes, raisins, some antibiotics\nSevere or recurrent kidney infections (pyelonephritis)\nCertain immune-mediated illnesses\nInherited kidney defects in some breeds\n\n¬†\n\nWhy the kidneys matter\n\nThe kidneys are two small organs in your cat‚Äôs tummy.\n\nUrinary tract in cats.They carry out a number of essential functions, including:\n\nControlling fluid and salt levels in the body\nRemoving toxins and waste from the blood\nProducing some hormones.\n\nWhen the kidneys stop working properly, the body can‚Äôt control fluid and salt levels. All the organs and tissues which depend on this control also start to struggle. This includes the heart, muscles and brain. The damage gets worse as harmful waste products continue to accumulate.\n\nSymptoms of chronic kidney disease in cats\n\nThe symptoms of kidney disease result from losing control of fluid balance in the body and from build-up of waste products.\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\nDrinking and peeing (urinating) more\nLosing weight and eating less\nSleeping more\nVomiting¬†from time to time\nDeveloping a dull staring coat\nDeveloping bad breath and pale gums (anaemia)\n\nChronic kidney disease isn‚Äôt painful in the early stages or when controlled\n\nIn the later stages of chronic kidney disease, your cat may develop¬†high blood pressure¬†(hypertension), This is a dangerous complication of chronic kidney disease. Symptoms include:\n\nHead-pressing and staring into space\nSudden blindness\nSeizures\n\nCall your nearest vet if you think your cat has developed symptoms of high blood pressure.\n\nCats at higher risk of chronic kidney disease\n\nAlthough we don‚Äôt usually know why chronic kidney disease happens, some factors increase your cat‚Äôs risk of developing the condition. For example:\n\nRecurrent kidney infections¬†(pyelonephritis)\n\nInherited abnormalities:\n\nAmyloidosis ‚Äì abnormal proteins build up in the kidneys and stop them working¬†properly. Amyloidosis happens in Siamese and Abyssinian cats but is rare in other breeds.\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD)- fluid-filled cysts may develop in the kidneys. Persian cats (and their related breeds) are susceptible.\n\nIllness elsewhere¬†in the body, such as sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\n¬†\n\nAre humans or other pets at risk?\n\nChronic kidney disease does not spread between cats or from cats to humans.\n\nDiagnosis of chronic kidney disease in cats\n\nCats only develop symptoms of CKD¬† when they‚Äôve lost about 70% of their kidney function. Another way of looking at this is that your cat only needs about half of one kidney to look normal. This means we usually only identify chronic kidney disease in advanced stages\n\nVets diagnose chronic kidney disease based on:\n\nSymptoms¬†\n\nUrine tests:¬†\n\nUrine specific gravity (USG) ‚Äì cats with chronic kidney disease have very dilute (weak) urine\nProtein levels ‚Äì Diseased kidneys leak increasing amounts of protein into the urine\nBacterial Culture ‚Äì Bacterial infection can cause kidney disease or make it worse\n\nBlood tests:\n\n¬†Urea (blood urea nitrogen, BUN) and Creatinine Levels. These raise when kidney function falls by around 60-70%. Both are very useful tests.¬†But¬†things like diet, dehydration and exercise can also influence them.\nSDMA¬†(symmetric dimethylarginine) is a new test. It detects kidney disease early when around 25% of kidney function is lost (rather than 60-70%). This means diagnosing chronic kidney disease one to three years earlier than with BUN and creatinine alone.\nPhosphorus Levels. These increase because diseased kidneys can‚Äôt get rid of excess phosphorus from the body.\n\nX-ray or Ultrasound scan to check the shape, size and structure of the kidneys. These tests can detect kidney stones (uroliths, calculi), which can cause chronic kidney disease or make it worse.\n\nVet treatment for chronic kidney disease\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment for severe or advanced chronic kidney disease\nGiving fluids to treat dehydration caused by losing of too much fluid from the body as weak urine.¬†If your cat is very dehydrated, they may need to have fluids and medicine through a drip into their leg\nStabilising electrolyte (salt) levels in the blood to help nerves and muscles continue to work properly\nControlling of high blood pressure\n\n¬†\n\nOngoing treatment\n\nSpecial diets:¬†prescription diets for kidney disease contain the correct balance of high-quality protein, salt levels, essential fatty acids and appetite stimulants for cats with chronic kidney disease.\n\nMedication:¬†prescription tablets and liquid medicine\n\nAnti-sickness medication to reduce nausea and vomiting\nAppetite stimulants to encourage eating\nMedicine to reduce protein loss in urine and minimise weight loss\nPotassium supplements ‚Äì Essential support for heart and muscle function\nGastric (stomach) protectants ‚Äì To protect the stomach lining\n\nKidney transplants?¬† Although these are carried out in some other countries, kidney transplants in cats are banned in the UK\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stabilise symptoms and quality of life for as long as possible. Chronic kidney disease is harder to control in advanced stages, especially with raised phosphorus levels and high blood pressure. Successful control is also harder in cats with other illnesses.\n\nHome care for your cat with kidney disease\n\nMost cats with chronic kidney disease do very well on home treatment. The following tips will help to keep your cat well for longer and minimise extra trips to the vet.\n\nEnsure your cat has free access to water at all times\nFeed a special prescription diet for kidney disease\nAlways give prescribed medicine and supplements as directed\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with chronic kidney disease\n\nWhen the symptoms are under control, your cat can enjoy a full and happy life.\n\nEncourage your cat to drink as much as possible. Use water fountains and add water to food\nFind a prescription kidney diet your cat likes and keep to it\nWarm food up and add low-salt chicken stock or fish broth to encourage your cat to eat if their appetite is poor\nGive prescription medicines as directed and in a way that doesn‚Äôt stress your cat or you\n\nGetting your cat to eat is more important than persisting with things which won‚Äôt work.\n\nHelping your cat to enjoy good quality of life is the most important goal.\n\n¬†\n\nQuality of life\n\nChronic kidney disease gets progressively worse. Eventually, the symptoms can no longer be controlled. When this happens, it may be kindest to end your cat‚Äôs life peacefully through euthanasia.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to say goodbye\n\nYou may be anxious about how you‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs time to say goodbye. It‚Äôs a decision that‚Äôs very hard to make and distressing for everyone involved. The best any of us can do is focus on what‚Äôs best for our beloved companion.

For example Bernese Mountain Dogs, Shar-Peis and terrier breeds.\n\nKidneys carry out a number of essential functions in the body. As dogs get older, their kidneys gradually become less efficient. The reason why this happens isn‚Äôt known. There are triggers which can make it happen earlier or progress quicker. These include toxins, infections and other illnesses. There‚Äôs no cure for chronic kidney disease.¬†Eventually, the kidneys will fail completely. But the rate of deterioration varies between dogs. Symptoms of CKD can often¬†be stabilised¬†for prolonged periods. Early diagnosis and treatment help achieve the best outcome for the longest time.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease?\n\nChronic kidney disease means your dog‚Äôs kidneys have suffered damage over a long time. The damage can‚Äôt be reversed or cured. Eventually, the kidneys will stop working completely.\n\nWe often don‚Äôt know how the kidneys get damaged. Ageing change is part of the cause, but other factors can include:\n\nExposure to toxins: anti-freeze, grapes, raisins, some antibiotics\nSevere or recurrent infections (pyelonephritis, leptospirosis)\nImmune-mediated illnesses\nSome clotting disorders\nInherited kidney defects in certain breeds\nCertain medicines\n\n¬†\n\nWhy the kidneys matter\n\nThe kidneys are two small organs in your dog‚Äôs tummy. They carry out a number of essential functions, including:\n\nManaging fluid balance in the body by controlling how much urine they produce\nRemoving harmful waste and toxins from the blood and getting rid of them in urine\nSensing and controlling levels of essential minerals and electrolytes (salts) in the blood\nProducing or activating hormones which control blood pressure, calcium metabolism and production of red blood cells\n\nSymptoms of chronic kidney disease in dogs\n\nThe symptoms of kidney disease are due to poor control of fluid levels in the body and the accumulation of waste products.\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\nDrinking and peeing (urinating) more\nLosing weight and eating less\nSleeping more and weakness\nVomiting¬†from time-to-time\nHaving a dull, staring coat\nDeveloping bad breath (halitosis)\nHaving pale gums (anaemia)\n\nChronic kidney disease isn‚Äôt painful in the early stages or when it‚Äôs controlled\n\nIn later stages of CKD, your dog may develop¬†high blood pressure¬†(hypertension). This is a dangerous complication of the condition.\nSymptoms of high blood pressure due to CKD include:\nHead-pressing and staring into space\nSudden blindness\nSeizures\n\nCall your nearest vet if your dog develops these symptoms.\n\nAre some dogs at higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease than others?\n\nAlthough we don‚Äôt usually know why chronic kidney disease happens, some factors increase your dog‚Äôs risk of developing the condition. For example:\n\nRecurrent kidney infections¬†(pyelonephritis)\n\nInherited abnormalities:\n\nGlomerulonephritis of Bernese Mountain dogs\nRenal amyloidosis: abnormal proteins damage the kidney in Shar-Pei dogs\nFanconi syndrome: abnormal salt absorption in Basenji dogs\nSmall underdeveloped kidneys (renal hypoplasia or dysplasia) in Miniature Schnauzers, Chow chows, Alaskan Malamute, Standard Poodles, Cocker Spaniels, Shih Tzus, Samoyeds, Doberman Pinschers\nPolycystic kidney disease (rare) in English Cocker spaniels, Beagles, Bull Terriers, Westies and Cairn Terriers\n\nLong-term illness elsewhere¬†in the body. For example sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and heart disease\n\nCertain infectious diseases¬†(leishmaniasis)\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching chronic kidney disease?\n\nChronic kidney disease does not spread between dogs or from dogs to humans.\n\nDiagnosis of chronic kidney disease\n\nDogs only develop symptoms of CKD¬† when they‚Äôve lost about 70% of their kidney function. Another way of looking at this is that your dog only needs about half of one kidney to look normal. This means we usually only identify CKD in advanced stages.\n\nVets diagnose chronic kidney disease based on:\n\nSymptoms\n\nUrine tests:¬†\n\nUrine specific gravity (USG): dogs with chronic kidney disease have very dilute (weak) urine\nProtein levels: diseased kidneys leak increasing amounts of protein into the urine\nBacterial Culture: bacterial infection can cause kidney disease or make it worse\n\nBlood tests:\n\nUrea (blood urea nitrogen, BUN) and Creatinine Levels. These raise when kidney function falls by around 60-70%. Both are very useful tests.¬†But¬†things like diet, dehydration and exercise can also influence them.\nSDMA(symmetric dimethylarginine) is a new test. It detects kidney disease early when around 25% of kidney function is lost (rather than 60-70%). This means diagnosing chronic kidney disease one to three years earlier than with BUN and creatinine alone.\nPhosphorus Levels: these increase because diseased kidneys can‚Äôt get rid of excess phosphorus from the body.\n\nX-ray or Ultrasound scan to check the shape, size and structure of the kidneys. These tests can detect kidney stones (uroliths, calculi), which can cause chronic kidney disease or make it worse.\n\nVet treatment for chronic kidney disease in dogs\n\nThe goal of treatment is stabilising the condition and minimising further damage.\n\nTreatment for severe or advanced chronic kidney disease:\n\nFluids to treat dehydration caused by loss of too much fluid from the body as weak urine.\nTreating severe dehydration with fluids and medicine through a drip into their leg\nStabilising (salt) levels in the blood to maintain nerve and muscle function\nControlling high blood pressure\n\nOngoing Treatment:\n\nSpecial diets-¬†¬†prescription diets for kidney disease contain the correct balance of high-quality protein, salt levels, essential fatty acids and appetite stimulants for cats with CKD\n\nMedications\n\nAnti-sickness medication to reduce nausea and vomiting.\nAppetite stimulants to encourage eating.\nMedicine to reduce protein loss in urine and minimise weight loss.\nPotassium supplements: essential support for heart and muscle function\nGastric protectants: to protect the stomach lining\n\nKidney transplants?¬† Although these are carried out in some other countries, kidney transplants in dogs are banned in the UK\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stabilise symptoms and quality of life for as long as possible. Chronic kidney disease is harder to control in advanced stages, especially with raised phosphorus levels and high blood pressure. Successful control is also harder in dogs with other illnesses.\n\nCaring for your dog at home\n\nMost dogs with chronic kidney disease do very well in home care. The following tips will help to keep your dog well for longer and minimise extra trips to the vet.\n\nEnsure your dog has free access to water at all times\nIdeally, feed a prescription diet for kidney disease\nAlways give prescribed medicine and supplements as directed\n\nGiving dogs medication is often challenging, especially if they have a poor appetite.\n\nSpeak to a vet or veterinary nurse for advice and tips on giving medicine to your dog.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a dog with chronic kidney disease\n\nWhen the symptoms are under control, your dog can enjoy a full and happy life.\n\nEncourage your dog to drink as much as possible, adding water to food if necessary.\nFind a prescription kidney diet your dog likes and keep to it.\nWarm food up and add low-salt chicken stock or fish broth to encourage your dog to eat if their appetite is poor.\nGive prescription medicines at the dose and times advised, and in a way that doesn‚Äôt stress your dog or you.\n\nGetting your dog to eat is more important than persisting with things which won‚Äôt work.\n\nProlonging a good quality of life is the most important goal.\n\n¬†\n\nQuality of Life\n\nChronic kidney disease is progressive. Eventually, kidney damage will be so advanced that the symptoms can no longer be controlled. When this happens, it may be kindest to end your dog‚Äôs life peacefully through euthanasia.\n\nYou may worry if you‚Äôll know when it is time to say goodbye. It‚Äôs a decision that‚Äôs very hard to make and distressing for everyone involved. The best any of us can do is focus on what‚Äôs best for our beloved companion. We can start by thinking about their quality of life:\n\nDo good things outweigh the bad?\nDo they still enjoy things and take an interest in life?\nAre other illnesses well-controlled?\nDo you wonder if each day will be the last?\nAre you and they exhausted?\nIs giving medication straightforward or is it a fight that‚Äôs worsening quality of life for both you and your dog?\n\nThere are guides available online to help you assess your dog‚Äôs quality of life.\n\nTalk things through with a vet if you are concerned about your dog‚Äôs quality of life.\n\nAssess quality of life\n\nCan chronic kidney disease be prevented in dogs?\n\nWe can‚Äôt prevent chronic kidney disease when the cause is unknown. But we can minimise the additional risk factors.\n\nKeep potential toxins out of sight, smell and reach of dogs\nFeed your dog a high-quality diet appropriate for their age and lifestyle\nEnsure your dog gets regular health checks with a vet\nCheck your dog‚Äôs weight regularly for any unexpected weight loss\nTreat any other illnesses promptly\n\nWhen to worry about your dog with kidney disease\n\nCall your nearest vet practice if your dog:\n\nGoes suddenly blind\nCollapses\nDevelops severe vomiting or diarrhoea with blood\nIs having a fit or seizure\nStops drinking altogether\n\nJoii can help with:\n\nRecognising the signs of chronic kidney disease\nCaring for a dog with chronic kidney disease\nFinding the best diets for your dog with kidney disease\nGiving medicine to dogs who are unwell\nTempting your poorly dog to eat\nTalking through end of life care\nUnderstanding euthanasia\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

These infections tend to be mild.\n\nKennel cough can be caused by different viruses and bacteria. It is caught from infected dogs or contaminated objects. Dogs often sound like they have something stuck in their throat. Other common symptoms are a runny nose and sneezing. Most dogs will get better without treatment, but puppies and seniors need close monitoring.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Kennel cough?\n\nRespiratory infection of dogs, can also affect other species\n\nOften requires no treatment other than rest and TLC\n\nRarely dangerous, but very young or senior dogs more vulnerable\n\nVery rarely it can affect immunocompromised people\n\nPlease call us or your local vet if your pet is very lethargic, not eating or breathing seems laboured\n\n¬†\n\nPossible symptoms of Kennel cough\n\nDry, hacking cough, like they have something stuck in their throat\n\nClear discharge from nose\n\nSneezing\n\nReduced appetite\n\nReduced energy levels (lethargy)\n\n¬†\n\nDogs at higher risk of getting Kennel cough\n\nVery young puppies (up to 16 weeks)\n\nSenior dogs, especially those with diseases that affect their immune system\n\nBrachycephalic (flat-nose) breeds (Frenchies, Bulldogs, Pugs)\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching Kennel cough?\n\nMost viruses that cause Kennel cough are specific to dogs and will not affect people or other common pets.\n\nThe bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica can spread to other species. Even so, it will be harmless to people unless they are immunocompromised. Guinea pigs are very susceptible to serious illness from this bug, so you will need to isolate them from your pooch if they are coughing.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is Kennel cough diagnosed\n\nMilder cases can be suspected based on examination. If symptoms are more severe, complications are suspected, or symptoms do not improve, chest x-rays are recommended.\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment for Kennel cough\n\nMost cases only need a bit of extra care and support. Please see a few tips below on how you can help your pet recover.\n\nIf the coughing is very intense or uncomfortable, your vet may prescribe an anti-inflammatory.\n\nIf your dog has a fever, congestion in their airways or the lungs become affected, antibiotics and other medications may also be necessary.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog recover from Kennel cough at home\n\nAs their throat will be a little sore, it may be easier for them to eat soft food and smaller meals while they recover. This will also help them stay hydrated.\n\nWater vapour helps clear any congestion in their airways, so exposing them to steam by having them in the room when the shower is being used is often helpful.\n\nResting for a few days will prevent further irritation to their airways and help them recover.\n\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how¬† to prevent Kennel cough\n\nVaccinating your dog will reduce the risk of getting Kennel cough or reduce the symptoms if they still catch it.\n\nIf your dog has Kennel cough, keep them away from other animals at risk of infection for two weeks after the symptoms clear.\n\nDisinfection of objects and surfaces in the room where your dog is staying is necessary, normal household disinfectants work well. Joii can help if you need more tips about this.\n\nIf you need to see your vet, let them know your dog is coughing and discuss with them the best way to organise your visit.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about Kennel Cough\n\nSpeak to a vet in the Joii app or your local practice if your pet:\n\nIs constantly tired or lethargic\n\nIs not eating or drinking much\n\nIs breathing faster or with more effort than usual\n\nHas thick or abundant nasal discharge\n\nIs not getting better after 10-14 days\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

    "text": "What to do\nCauses\nWhen to worry\nPrevention\nDiagnosis\nHome treatment\nVet treatment\nRisk\nüê∂ in dogs\nüê± in cats\nLumps in cats\nWritten by Dr Valter Carlos\non May 5, 2023\n\nIt is always stressful to find a lump on your cat, but there are many possible causes. Sadly, the more common ones are infections and tumours, and veterinary treatment will usually be required.\n\nLumps can happen due to infection, inflammation, an abnormal growth, fluid build-up, or an anatomical problem like a hernia. You can check a list of some common causes and read a brief explanation below.\n\nWhat to do if you find a lump on your cat\n\nIf your cat has a bleeding lump, apply gentle pressure to the area for 60 seconds. If the bleeding continues or is severe, continue applying pressure but contact a vet for further advice straight away. Even if the bleeding stops, it is likely to happen again, and a vet assessment is recommended.\n\nIf the lump is painful or your cat is unwell, for example, hiding away or refusing to eat, they may have an abscess or injury. Contact a vet for further advice immediately.\n\nIf your cat is completely normal apart from the lump, monitor them closely and contact your vet when possible. It can be very useful to take photos of the area where you see or feel the lump. If possible, measuring the lump is also helpful.\n\nCommon causes of lumps in cats\nInfections and abscesses are a common cause of lumps in cats, often caused by fighting with other cats. Usually, these lumps are around the face, lower parts of the legs, lower back or near the base of the tail. There may be a scab in the middle of the lump.\nA small lump is common after an injection, especially after vaccines in kittens. This usually resolves after 3-6 weeks. If it becomes bigger than 2cm, is still growing after a month or is still present after 3 months, testing is recommended.\nAllergic reactions can cause multiple small, scabby lumps all over the cat‚Äôs body. They can also cause a small, red lump to develop near the lips¬†or a red raised area on their tummy or back legs.\nLumps can be due to a tumour or growth. About 50% of growths on a cat‚Äôs skin are cancerous, so it is advisable to test any lumps if unsure of their cause. Common examples are squamous cell carcinomas, fibrosarcomas, mast cell tumours, basal cell tumours or¬†warts.\nCysts related to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles are common. These are not dangerous but can cause irritation and get infected.\nUmbilical hernias can cause a small lump in very young kittens. This is when the space where the umbilical cord was does not close properly. Abdominal fat squeezes through the muscle and can be felt under the skin. Small hernias should close on their own, but larger ones may need surgery.\nHernias can also happen after a traumatic injury, like a road traffic accident or fall.

A lump that is painful, bleeding, or is producing discharge may need urgent treatment.\n\nLumps can happen due to infection, inflammation, an abnormal growth, fluid build-up, or an anatomical problem like a hernia. You can check a list of some common causes and read a brief explanation below.\n\nWhat to do if you find a lump on your dog\n\nIf your dog has a bleeding lump, apply gentle pressure to the area for 60 seconds. If the bleeding continues or is severe, continue applying pressure but contact a vet straight away for further advice. Even if the bleeding stops, it is likely to happen again, and a vet assessment is recommended.\n\nContact a vet for further advice immediately if the lump is painful or your dog is otherwise unwell, for example, lethargic or refusing to eat.\n\nIf your dog is completely normal apart from the lump, monitor them closely and contact your vet when possible. It can be very useful to measure the lump and take a couple of photos of the area where you see or feel it.\n\nCommon causes of lumps on dogs\n\nInfections and abscesses are common cause of lumps. These are most common on the paws, face, neck, tail and anal sacs. A wound is not always visible. Abscesses can sometimes burst and drain pus.\n\nAllergic reactions can cause multiple red, raised wheals all over the dog‚Äôs body, especially their back and sides.\n\nAllergies can also lead to nodules forming between the toes, usually called interdigital cysts or granulomas.\n\nLumps can be due to a tumour or growth. Many of these are benign, such as¬†warts, but cancerous lumps are still common. A vet assessment is recommended. This is more urgent if the lump is red, sore, or growing rapidly.\n\nLymphoma can cause swelling of one or more lymph nodes, and this can be noticed as one or more lumps under the skin. This should be assessed by a vet as soon as possible.\n\nFatty lumps, or lipomas, are common in older and overweight dogs and are almost always benign. These are often very soft to the touch and move freely under the skin. They can still cause trouble if growing rapidly, especially if they are near areas of movement such as the groin or axilla.\n\nCysts related to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles are common. These are not dangerous but can cause irritation and get infected. If this happens, surgical removal is recommended.\n\nUmbilical and inguinal hernias can cause belly or groin lumps in puppies. This is when the space for the umbilical cord or inguinal canal does not close properly. Some abdominal material squeezes through the muscle and can be felt under the skin. Small umbilical hernias should close on their own but larger ones may need surgery. Inguinal (groin) hernias are often more serious and should be checked by a vet.\n\nHernias can also happen after a traumatic injury, like a road traffic accident, and these require urgent treatment.\n\nWhen should I worry? What do cancerous lumps look like?\n\nIf a lump is painful or your dog is otherwise unwell, a vet assessment should be done as soon as possible. Joii can help you decide if an emergency vet visit is necessary.\n\nNo one can tell if a lump is cancerous just from the way it looks or feels. Testing is recommended, especially if the lump is growing rapidly or surrounded by redness and inflammation.\n\nCan I prevent lumps on my dog?\n\nFatty lumps have been associated with being overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight may prevent their development.\n\nGood management of skin allergies, with appropriate diet and medications, if necessary, will help prevent interdigital granulomas.\n\nWhat should I look out for if I find a lump on my dog?\n\nLumps that are painful, inflamed or bothering your dog should be checked as soon as possible.\n\nA lump that has been present for a while but suddenly changes should be checked promptly. Some benign growths can turn malignant.\n\nChanges in appetite or weight loss could mean things are more serious as well.\n\nHow can I help my dog with their lump?\n\nIf a lump ruptures and is draining fluid, clean the area thoroughly with saline (roughly 1 tsp salt/500ml cooled boiled water) and seek advice from a vet.\n\nBandages can cause damage to the lump or skin if applied incorrectly. It is usually better to use a recovery collar or a medical vest to prevent injury.\n\nWhat is the vet treatment for lumps on dogs?\n\nPainful lumps will be treated with pain medication in addition to further investigations.\n\nAbscesses will need to be drained and flushed to remove the infectious material. Antibiotics may also be necessary.\n\nAllergic reactions may require steroid medications. Further investigations may be advised to determine the trigger for the allergic reaction.\n\nFor suspected growths or tumours, one of the two tests below can be performed before deciding if surgical removal is needed.\n\nA fine needle aspiration involves scraping a few cells from within the lump with a needle. This is usually a simple test to perform and can provide a lot of information, but the results may be inconclusive.\nFor a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy may be required. This involves removing a portion or the whole of the lump under anaesthesia.\n\nIs my dog at higher risk of developing lumps?\n\nDogs that eat bones or play with sticks are at higher risk of injuries to the inside of their mouth or throat. This can lead to an abscess or lump under the skin.\n\nOlder dogs are more likely to get tumours.\n\nSome breeds of dogs are more likely to get specific tumours, but the general risk of cancer is similar across all breeds.\n\nOther causes of lumps in dogs\n\nSometimes fluid or blood can build up after surgery or an injury and form a lump under the skin. This is likely to resolve by itself but should be checked by a vet to be safe.\n\nViolent head shaking or scratching can lead to a lump forming on the ear of dogs, this is due to bleeding under the skin and is called an Aural Haematoma. This can be very painful and require immediate treatment, always check with your vet.\n\nBulldogs are prone to develop inflammatory reactions on or between their toes, especially if they allergic skin disease. These are called interdigital cysts.\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

If caught early, treatment is usually successful, and the outlook is excellent.\n\nWhat is mange?\n\nMange is a¬†parasitic¬†skin disease caused by tiny mites that live under the surface of the skin and in the hair follicles. These mites are so small that they are not visible to the eye.\n\nMange is caused by two different types of mites in cats: sarcoptes and demodex.\n\nDemodex is also known as Demodicosis. It is fairly uncommon in cats.\n\nIt is species-specific, so it does not spread from cats to humans or dogs.\nOne form of Demodex can be spread between cats.\nIt can affect any age but is most common in young cats and cats with a weakened immune system, such as those with feline immunodeficiency virus or feline leukaemia virus.\n\nSarcoptes is also known as Scabies. It is also fairly uncommon but highly contagious.\n\nIt can be spread from other animals by direct contact and shared bedding, toys, and grooming equipment.\nIt can affect both indoor and outdoor cats. Scabies can spread quickly in stray cat populations.\n\n¬†\n\nIf left untreated, mange can worsen and lead to a secondary bacterial infection in the skin. Speak to a vet as soon as possible if you are concerned about mange. Our Joii team are available 24 hours a day.\n\nHow to tell if your cat has mange\n\nYour cat may develop one or more of the following signs with mange\n\nHair loss can be one of the early stages.\nItching, licking, or biting at the skin. This can range from mild to very severe.\nRed, inflamed, crusty, or scabby skin\nThickened skin\nEar infections\nLip ulcers\nLethargy\nHair loss is one of the first signs of mange\n\n¬†\n\nSarcoptic mange\n\nSymptoms usually begin around non-haired areas, such as the ears, armpits, and tummy, but can spread all over the body.\nScabies lesions in a cat\n\nDemodectic mange can be\n\nLocalised: found commonly on the face, head, and neck.\nGeneralised: when the lesions appear all over the body.\nLesions often start around the face\n\nAre some cats at greater risk of mange than others?\nCats with weaker immune systems are more at risk. This includes cats that are elderly, very young, or have current health issues such as diabetes, FIV, or FeLV.\nThere are some breeds that have been linked to an increased risk of demodex, such as Siamese and Burmese.\n\n¬†\n\nCan humans catch mange from cats?\nSarcoptic mange can spread to other cats, dogs, and even humans. The symptoms in humans are usually very mild, as they cannot live on the skin for very long. The main symptom is itching. We recommend¬†speaking to your GP¬†to discuss whether treatment is needed.\n\nHow is mange in cats diagnosed?\nYour vet will usually diagnose mange based on the way the skin appears and by looking at skin scrapes or tape smears under a microscope.\nThey may also be found by a hair pluck sample or skin biopsy.\nSome types of mange can be difficult to diagnose, so your vet may do a medication trial even if the skin scrapes are negative.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for mange in cats?\nMedication is used to kill the mites, usually a tablet or spot-on. This is only available as a prescription medication. Over-the-counter products are not effective against mites. Repeated doses for several months may be required.\nOral antibiotics, shampoos, or creams for any secondary bacterial skin infection.\nAnti-itch or anti-inflammatory medication may also be needed.\nThe cost of treating mange varies depending on the circumstances. Sometimes medication to kill the mites is all that is needed. Costs may be higher if there is a secondary skin infection because other medications will be needed.\n\nYour vet might also perform tests to check for underlying health conditions such as feline leukaemia, feline immunodeficiency, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and allergic or auto-immune skin conditions.\n\nWhat to do at home if your cat has mange\n\nOne form of¬†demodectic mange¬†can be contagious, so we recommend routinely cleaning all toys, bedding, and collars if your cat has been diagnosed with this. All cats in the household will also need treatment.\n\nThe following guidelines apply only to¬†sarcoptic mange, which is highly contagious:\n\nIsolate your cat from other animals until the mites have cleared.\nStandard household disinfectants are effective against mites. Use these for any surfaces and furniture your cat has been in contact with. The mites do not survive very long in the environment.\nWash all of their bedding, your bedding, clothes, harnesses, and blankets in a hot wash¬†(50¬∞C or higher).\nTreat all other pets that have been in regular, close contact. The only medication effective against mites is only available on prescription.\n\n¬†\n\nNatural remedies and supplements can also be used, alongside prescription medication, to help reduce the symptoms. Supplements containing essential omega oils can help protect the skin barrier. Shampoos or mousses can help soothe and protect the skin.\n\nSpeak to our Joii team today to find out more.\n\nTips on how to prevent mange in cats\nSome prescription anti-flea and deworming medications also prevent and treat mites. Your local vet should be able to prescribe this for you.\nBrush your cat regularly and check for any abnormalities in the fur and skin.\nClean your cat‚Äôs bowls, blankets, and collars often.\nFeed your cat good-quality food and make sure they have a healthy weight.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\n\nWhat to do if you are worried about mange in cats\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour cat has swollen lymph nodes or is lethargic.\nYour cat‚Äôs skin lesions¬†have spread all over their body.\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYour cat is itchy or has mild skin problems.\nYou have any questions about skin supplements for cats.\nYou have any questions about parasite control in cats.\nYou have any questions about your cat‚Äôs nutrition or weight.\n\nRead our articles to find out other conditions that can make your cat Itchy, or cause Pain or¬†Stress\n\n 1 0\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This includes dogs that are elderly, very young, or those with other underlying health issues, such as diabetes or cancer.\nSome breeds have an increased risk of demodex. These include¬†Shar-Pei, Shih Tzu, West Highland White Terrier, Pug, Boxer, Border Terrier, and Bull breeds.\n\n¬†\n\nCan humans catch mange from dogs?\nSarcoptic mange can spread to other dogs, cats, and even humans.\nThe symptoms in humans are usually very mild, as the mites cannot live on the skin for long.\nThe main symptom is itching.¬†We recommend speaking to your¬†GP¬†to discuss whether you need treatment.\n\nHow is mange in dogs diagnosed?\nYour vet will usually diagnose mange based on the way the symptoms appear and by looking at scrapings of the skin under a microscope.\nMites may also be found on a hair pluck sample or skin biopsy.\nSome types of mange are difficult to diagnose. Your vet may do a medication trial even if the skin tests are negative.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for mange in dogs?\nThe localised form of demodex in puppies sometimes clears without any medication.\nMedication to treat and kill the mites usually comes as a tablet or spot-on. This is only available from your local vet, as it is a prescription drug. Over-the-counter products are not effective against mites. Repeated doses for several months are often required.\nOral antibiotics, shampoos, or creams for any secondary bacterial skin infection.\nAnti-itch or anti-inflammatory medication.\nThe cost of treatment for mange in the UK can vary. If caught and treated early, the costs will usually be lower. If a secondary skin infection is present, then extra medication will increase costs.\n\nYour vet might also perform tests to check for underlying health conditions such as Cushing‚Äôs disease, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, liver disease, and allergic or auto-immune skin conditions.\n\n¬†\n\nHome treatment if your dog has mange\n\n¬†\n\nDemodex\n\nDemodex is not contagious in dogs. We recommend routine cleaning of all toys, bedding, and collars.\n\n¬†\n\nSarcoptes\n\nThis type of mange is contagious.\n\nIsolate your dog from other animals until the mites have cleared.\nStandard household disinfectants are effective against mites. Use these for any surfaces and furniture your dog has been in contact with. The mites don‚Äôt survive very long in the environment.\nWash all bedding, clothes, harnesses, and blankets that your dog had contact with in a hot wash¬†at 50¬∞C or higher.\nTreat all other pets that have been in close contact. This medication needs a prescription from your local vet.\n\n¬†\n\nNatural remedies and supplements can help with the itching and protect the skin barrier. You can use these together with prescription medications. Speak to our Joii team to find out more.\n\nTips on how to prevent mange in dogs\nSome prescription anti-flea and deworming medications prevent and treat mites. Your local vet should be able to prescribe this for you.\nAvoid walking your dog in areas that have a large population of foxes.\nRegularly check your dog‚Äôs skin and brush them thoroughly.\nClean your dog‚Äôs collar, harness, blankets, and bowls often.\nFeed a good quality diet and keep your dog in healthy body condition.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\nWhen to worry about mange in dogs\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour dog has swollen lymph glands or is lethargic.\nYour dog‚Äôs skin lesions¬†have spread all over their body.\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYour dog has mild skin problems.\nYou have questions about natural remedies to use at home for your dog‚Äôs skin.\nYou have questions about parasite control in dogs.\nYou have questions about your dog‚Äôs nutrition or weight.\n\nFind out other causes of Itchy dogs and¬†Pain in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

The condition affects cats of any age, sex or breed, although cats over 7 years old and Siamese cats are most at risk. Up to 40% of all UK cats will get pancreatitis at some time in their lives.\n\nThe pancreas is a gland in your cat‚Äôs tummy. It produces powerful chemicals to digest food in the intestines. Sometimes the gland becomes swollen and painful.¬† Symptoms of pancreatitis include not eating, lethargy and diarrhoea. Around 50% of cats who get pancreatitis also have an inflamed small intestine and liver, a condition called triaditis. Pancreatitis needs to be treated by a vet, and not all cats recover from the illness. For cats who do recover, pancreatitis can lead to longer-term illness.\n\nWhat is pancreatitis in cats?\n\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is a small¬† gland located in your cat‚Äôs abdomen, close to their stomach\n\n¬†\n\nIt has 2 important functions:\n\nCreating powerful¬†digestive enzymes¬†(digestive juices) to break down food\nProducing the hormone¬†insulin, which lowers glucose (sugar) levels in your cat‚Äôs blood\n\nPancreatitis may be sudden (acute), or it may come on gradually and last longer (chronic)\n\nChronic pancreatitis is more common in cats (unlike dogs)\n\nCats who have had one bout of pancreatitis are more likely to suffer another one sometime in the future\n\nWhen the pancreas gets¬†badly¬†damaged, your cat may become unable to digest food (EPI). It¬†can also lead to sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus)\n\n¬†\n\nHow does pancreatitis happen?\nPowerful digestive enzymes (digestive juices) produced inside the pancreas start to work too soon\nThe pancreas gets damaged\nThe gland becomes swollen and inflamed\nNeighbouring organs, including the liver and small intestine become inflamed\n\nIn around 95% of cases, the actual cause of pancreatitis isn‚Äôt known. Vets call this ‚Äòidiopathic‚Äô.\n\n¬†\n\nPossible triggers for pancreatitis\nOther illnesses, including sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and inflammatory bowel disease\nInfections and parasites (for example, toxoplasmosis)\nObesity, which can be associated with higher levels of fats (called lipids) in the bloodstream\nToxins, including chocolate, lilies, zinc and organophosphates\nA blow to the abdomen (tummy) causing direct injury to the pancreas\nEating food with too much fat in it.\n\n¬†\n\nTriaditis\n\nYour cat‚Äôs pancreas works very closely with their small intestine, gallbladder and liver. The pancreas shares a duct (or pipe) with the gallbladder for transfer of digestive juices into the small intestine. The gallbladder sits in your cat‚Äôs liver and produces bile. Bile helps to digest fats in food. So it‚Äôs very easy for infection or inflammation to spread from the small intestine to the pancreas. and from pancreas to gallbladder and liver. This is one reason why up to 50% of cats with pancreatitis also have inflammation of their liver and small intestine. This condition is called triaditis.\n\nSymptoms of pancreatitis in Cats\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of acute pancreatitis\nNot wanting to eat\nHaving less energy\nDiarrhoea or soft stool (poo)\nSigns of tummy pain, including lip smacking, being restless, looking hunched\nVomiting¬†(being sick)\nCollapse\n\n¬†\n\n¬†Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis\n\nSymptoms are similar, but come on more gradually\n\nGoing off food intermittently\nDiarrhoea\nDrinking more\nHaving less energy\nVomiting intermittently (from time to time)\nLosing weight\n\nCats are more likely to get the chronic form of pancreatitis. Since the symptoms mimic other common conditions in cats, chronic pancreatitis can be difficult to identify in the early stages of the illness.\n\nCats at higher risk of developing pancreatitis\nCats who are obese (overweight)\nCats with other health problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease and sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus)\nCats receiving steroid treatment\nSiamese cats with a gene that causes high levels of fat in their blood\n\n¬†\n\nHow to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in cats\n\nWe don‚Äôt know for certain what causes pancreatitis in cats, so we can‚Äôt prevent it. However, you can reduce your cat‚Äôs risk by:\n\nEnsuring your cat eats a healthy diet\nControlling your cat‚Äôs weight\nTreating and monitoring other illnesses under veterinary advice\nBeing especially careful with the above tips if your cat is in a¬†higher risk group or breed¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose pancreatitis in cats?\n\nThere‚Äôs no specific test for pancreatitis. Vets diagnose pancreatitis based on:\n\nSymptoms\nPhysical examination\nBlood tests\nUltrasound scan to examine the structure and size of your cat‚Äôs pancreas\n\nVet treatment for pancreatitis\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a specific treatment or cure for pancreatitis.\n\nVets treat the symptoms of pancreatitis. Dietary rest and supportive treatments help the inflamed pancreas to recover.\n\nVet treatment includes:\n\nMedicine to treat vomiting and nausea\nFluids to prevent or treat dehydration\nRelieving pain\nFeeding a low-fat prescription diet\nAntibiotic treatment if needed\n\n¬†\n\n¬†Mild pancreatitis\n\nIf your cat can keep water down, they can be treated at home with prescription medication from the vet ‚Äì usually tablets or liquid\n\nAnti-sickness medicine\nPain relief\nAntacids\nSpecial diet (low-fat prescription diet)\n\n¬†\n\nSevere pancreatitis\n\nIf your cat is dehydrated, they will need intensive treatment.¬†This means staying in¬†hospital¬†to have:\n\nLife-saving fluids via a drip directly into their leg\nAnti-sickness injections\nStrong pain-killing injections\nAntibiotic injections\nFeeding through a stomach tube: your cat needs nutrition to recover from pancreatitis, but may not want to eat. If your cat is very unwell, the vet may have to give food via a tube directly into their stomach.\n\nHow to look after a cat with pancreatitis at home\nGive your cat medicine prescribed by your vet at the correct dose and time\nEncourage your cat to drink to avoid dehydration. Small frequent drinks are best.\nAdd water to food, especially warm water from cooking chicken breast\nSyringe small amounts of water directly into your cat‚Äôs mouth\nUse oral rehydration products¬†(‚ÄòOralade‚Äô, ‚ÄòLectade‚Äô)\nOffer small frequent feeds of light food, such as chicken or white fish or a prescription diet\nKeep your cat warm and quiet, and don‚Äôt let them outdoors until they‚Äôre well again\nSwitch to a low-fat diet long term to reduce the workload on the pancreas and the risk of pancreatitis recurring.\n\nFollowing this advice will help make sure your cat can continue their recovery in familiar surroundings at home. It may reduce the likelihood of expensive vet bills for emergency hospitalisation.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with pancreatitis\n\nEven after they get better, cats sometimes suffer from recurrent bouts of pancreatitis later on.\n\nFeeding the right diet and recognising the early signs of pancreatitis will help to keep your cat as healthy as possible for the longest time.\n\nFeed a balanced, low-fat diet\nOnly give your cat low-fat treats\nLearn to recognise the symptoms of pancreatitis in¬†your¬†cat\nCall a vet as soon as possible if you recognise the familiar signs of a relapse\n\nWhen to worry about your cat with pancreatitis\n\nMost cats with pancreatitis will start to improve within a day or two of starting the right treatment.

It affects all mammals, including dogs, cats, ferrets, and humans. Rabies spreads through the saliva of infected animals, and there is no cure.\n\nRabies is one of the world‚Äôs¬†deadliest¬†zoonotic¬†diseases. Zoonotic means that it can be transmitted from animals to humans.\n\nThe UK has been determined to be rabies-free since the early 20th century.\n\nWhat causes rabies in cats?\n\nRabies is a viral infection present worldwide that affects all mammals, including dogs, cats, and humans.\n\nIt spreads through infected saliva. Most commonly through bites from infected animals. It also spreads through scratches, open sores, and mucous membranes such as the gums.\nThe virus attacks the brain and spinal cord.\nCats start showing symptoms of the disease on average from 2 weeks to 8 weeks after infection. Though it can be from 10 days to several years. This can depend on the location of the bite and how much infected saliva it contains.\nIt is present worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa, and causes many deaths in those countries.\nCommon wildlife carriers of rabies abroad include raccoons, foxes, skunks, bats, and mongooses.\nMap of dog mediated rabies\n\n¬†\n\nRabies is extremely rare in the UK.\n\nEven though it is rare, rabies is a notifiable disease. This means it is the law to report cases to government authorities.\nThe last recorded case in a pet outside of quarantine was in a dog in 1969. This pet was from abroad.\nAll human cases in the UK since 1902 have been from abroad, except one from a bat in 2002. These have been mostly through dog bites.\nSome bats in the UK can carry a form of the rabies virus. Transmission from bats to humans in the UK is extremely unlikely. There was only 1 recorded case in 2002, and the individual was a bat handler. However, it‚Äôs recommended to avoid touching bats, even if they are not alive.\n\nSymptoms of rabies in cats\n\nEarly signs include\n\nLow energy, fever, and reduced appetite\nSudden behaviour changes. Shy cats become bolder, and active cats become nervous or anxious.\nVoice changes\n\nSymptoms of the next stage include\n\nAggressive behaviour towards humans, other animals, or objects\nDifficulty swallowing and foaming at the mouth\n\nThen\n\nWeak muscles and incoordination\nDifficulty breathing\nParalysis, seizures, and death\n\nAre some cats at more risk of rabies than others?\n\nCurrently, the UK is rabies-free. It is extremely unlikely in cats unless they have travelled abroad and had exposure to an infected animal.\n\nPets coming to the UK need a vaccination against rabies. If not, they cannot enter or will be in quarantine for up to 6 months. Some pets may also need titre testing. This depends on where they come from. This information is available on the UK government website.\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching rabies?\nHuman rabies is very rare in the UK.\nRabies can spread from infected animals to humans. You may be at risk if bitten or scratched by a mammal in a country that has rabies or a bat in the UK.\nThere is a human vaccine available for those at risk.\nIt is usually spread by a bite from an infected animal. It is also transmitted through scratches, open wounds, and mucous membranes such as the gums.\nIf you have had a bite from an infected animal, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and¬†seek medical help immediately.\nThere are no documented cases of rabies passing between people.\n\nHow is rabies diagnosed in cats?\nInitially, from the symptoms, a history of travel abroad, or exposure to an infected animal.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, samples of tissue from the brain or nerves are necessary. We can only take these samples after death.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for rabies in cats?\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for rabies in cats, and it is most often fatal.\nIf rabies¬†is suspected, cats need to stay in strict isolation.\nHumans can survive the disease if it‚Äôs caught and treated early.\n\nTips on how to prevent rabies in cats\nThe most effective way to prevent rabies is through vaccination.

An ‚Äòemergency‚Äô is a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or recurring multiple times in a short period.\n\nLonger-term treatment for seizures depends on the underlying cause but could include:\n\nAnti-seizure medicine given daily as tablets or liquid\nSpecific treatments to control blood sugar, electrolytes (salts) or other illness\nEmergency medication for treatment of seizures at home\n\nWhich cats are at higher risk for seizures?\nAdult to middle-aged cats\nCats with other illnesses\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This is called the pre-ictal phase or aura and may happen up to an hour before the seizure itself.\n\nDuring an aura your dog may be:\n\nRestless and pacing\nWhining\nExceptionally clingy\n\nYou may learn to recognise these cues in your dog and be able to take steps to create a safe environment.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn down the lights\nTurn off the television or music\nTurn off the heating (pets can overheat during seizures)\nCover hard corners and edges of furniture with cushions\nTake other pets and children to a different room\n\nThese steps will reduce stimulation of your pet‚Äôs brain and, in this way, help to reduce electrical stimulation feeding into the seizure.\n\nIf seizures happen regularly, your vet may prescribe sedative medication to give into your pet‚Äôs mouth or bottom. This medicine may be used either:\n\nTo control a seizure lasting longer than 3-5 minutes, or\nTo reduce the severity or prevent a fit completely, if an aura allows you to recognise when a severe one is about to happen.\n\nHow to know if your dog is going to have a fit\n\nSymptoms of a seizure or fit vary but often include:\n\nBecoming unsteady, losing balance\nFalling over, with stiffened muscles\nBecoming vacant or unconscious\nLying on their side and jerking their limbs\nDrooling saliva\nChomping and biting movements\nPassing faeces (poo) or urine (wee) without being aware of it\n\nThese are signs of the main seizure. The medical name for this is an ictus.\n\nFor a period of minutes to hours after the seizure, your dog may appear:\n\nDisorientated\nWobbly on their legs\nVery hungry\nVery sleepy\n\nThis is known as the post-ictal phase. It‚Äôs best to leave your pet to recover safely and peacefully in their familiar surroundings until this phase passes.\n\nThere can be many other symptoms of ‚Äòfull‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô seizures\n\nHow to treat a dog who has seizures at home\nPlease follow the advice above to reduce the risk of seizures happening\nGive any medication recommended by your vet at the correct times and doses\nStay calm and make sure your dog is safe from becoming injured during a fit\nAdminister any emergency medication, if you have some, as recommended by your vet\nLiving with a dog who suffers from seizures\n\nSometimes a seizure may be a one-off and your dog will never have another. Sometimes they happen infrequently, maybe once every year or two. However, for dogs with a condition like epilepsy, the first seizure may be followed by more frequent episodes.\n\nThe good news is that most dogs who experience seizures due to epilepsy can go on to live full and active lives. Although the disease cannot be cured, with the right medication and veterinary care, you and your canine best friend can continue to do all the things you enjoy together!\n\n¬†\n\nHow vets investigate seizures\n\nTo find out why your pet has had a seizure, vets will check the following\n\n‚ÄòHistory‚Äô ‚Äì your account of what happened and your pet‚Äôs general health\nGeneral and neurological examination ‚Äì checking things like balance and eyesight\nBlood and urine tests to check for liver or kidney disease, low blood sugar or abnormal electrolyte levels\nMRI or CT scans ‚Äì vets may recommend a closer examination of your dog‚Äôs brain using advanced tests such as MRI\nTests on samples of fluid from around the brain (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF)\n\nThese tests don‚Äôt always find something specifically wrong with your pet. This does not mean the investigation has ‚Äòfailed‚Äô. Rather, the cause of your dog‚Äôs seizure is most likely an intermittent ‚Äòelectrical fault‚Äô in their brain. The ‚Äòfault‚Äô comes and goes and leaves no trace in between.\n\nThis is what happens if your dog has epilepsy. Idiopathic Canine Epilepsy is the most common cause of recurrent seizures in dogs in the UK.\n\nIdiopathic is a medical word that means we don‚Äôt know the exact cause of the illness.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat seizures?\n\nIn emergencies, vets use sedatives and anti-seizure medicine injected directly into your dog‚Äôs veins to control seizures. An emergency is a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or recurring multiple times in a short period.\n\nLonger-term treatment for seizures depends on the underlying cause but could include:\n\nAnti-seizure medicine given daily as tablets or liquid\nSpecific treatments to control blood sugar, electrolytes or other illness\nEmergency medication for at home treatment of seizures lasting more than 3 minutes\n\nWhich dogs are at higher risk for seizures?\n\nWhile all dogs may be at risk of seizures, certain breeds are more likely to develop an inherited type of seizure known as epilepsy. The breeds most commonly affected include:\n\nGerman Shepherd\nCavalier King Charles Spaniel\nLabrador and retriever\nBorder Collie\nBoxer\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier\n\n(source Kennel Club (GB))\n\nThe reason for this susceptibility is currently unknown.\n\n 2\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Stress can affect cats of any age, breed, or sex. Behavioural changes are often the first sign of stress and can be sudden in onset or may develop more gradually.¬†\n\nCats are very good at hiding when they are in pain or stressed. Symptoms of stress are often subtle and hard to spot. It‚Äôs important to contact your vet with any changes in your cat‚Äôs behaviour.\n\nStress can lead to emotional and physical illness. One major physical illness related to stress is urinary blockages in male cats. This is a life-threatening emergency and needs to be treated immediately.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is stress in cats?\n\nStress is a common problem in cats and can appear as changes in their behaviour and physical health. The 2022 PDSA animal wellbeing survey shows that 44% of owners report their cats were showing signs of stress.\n\nFor a happy and healthy life, cats need several key resources\n\nAccess to food, water, a toilet area, a scratching area, a high perch, a play area, and a resting or sleeping area.\nIf these resources are not available, this can lead to them becoming stressed.\nThis is especially important in multi-cat households. The general rule to follow is one resource per cat plus one extra.\nCat owners need to make sure that there are enough resources for their cat(s) and that the resources are easily accessible to them.\n\n¬†\n\nOur Joii team are available 24 hours a day, call us now if you have any concerns with your cat.\n\nWhat can cause stress in cats?\n\nCats are all different, and some are more sensitive to certain changes than others.\n\nLack of key resources\nFood and water bowls too close together or too close to the litter tray\nLitter tray not cleaned regularly, changing the type or litter or tray being too small.\nNot enough litter trays, food, or water bowls for the number of cats in the household\nFood and water bowls or litter trays in busy or noisy areas\nNo access to a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù somewhere to hide\nNo scratching post\nBoredom, not enough mental or physical stimulation\nEnvironment changes\nMoving their bed, food/water bowls, or litter tray to a new area\nMoving home, building work, re-decorating, or new furniture\nAny change in the routine, such as staying at home more than normal, someone moving out, or going on holiday\nPeople visiting or a new baby in the home\nFireworks or unexpected loud noises\nTravelling in the car\nTrips to the vets\nSocial\nInappropriate handling\nPunishment: never punish your cat. This can lead to the worsening of behavioural problems.\nIntroducing new pets to the house.\nLiving in a multi-cat household: some cats prefer to live alone.\nLots of cats in the neighbourhood, especially those trespassing in your garden.\nMedical Conditions\nAny medical condition, illness, or injury can cause stress in cats. It is more with long-term disease and pain, such as kidney disease or Arthritis.\n\nAny changes in your cat‚Äôs environment can lead to stress. It‚Äôs best to anticipate and try to reduce this in plenty of time.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to tell if your cat is stressed\n\nStress in cats can lead to emotional and physical symptoms.\n\nBehavioural signs of stress\nScratching the furniture\nPassing urine or faeces outside of the litter tray\nSpraying around the house: squirting urine horizontally ‚Äì tail usually quivers\nAggression toward other animals or people\nHiding away or becoming withdrawn\nDemanding more attention or affection\nMeowing excessively or pacing around\nExcessive grooming\nIncreased sensitivity to touch, noise, or movements\nCertain body language\nCrouching or not moving\nTail close to the body\nArching back\nEars flat and back\nWide eyes and large pupils\nLicking lips or swallowing\nHissing, spitting, or growling\n\n¬†\n\nStressed facial expressions\n\n¬†\n\nHunched body indicates stress\n\n¬†\n\nStressed body language\nPhysical health\nEating and drinking less or more than normal\nVomiting or diarrhoea\nPoor coat condition: scruffy or matted\nHair loss (alopecia) and skin sores\nWeight loss\nRunny eyes and nose\nEating non-food items, also called PICA\nLow energy (lethargy), sleeping more than normal\nBlood in urine\nSquatting, painful or more frequent urination\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of stress than others?\n\nCats of any age, breed, and sex can become stressed. Like humans, cats are all individuals and react differently to changes in routine.\n\nHowever, some risk factors that can lead to stress include\n\nPregnant cats that are stressed or have incorrect nutrition: the litter will be at a higher risk of developing stress.\nA lack of socialisation as a kitten can lead to fear-related problems in the future.\nRescue cats with pre-existing issues\nMulti-cat households or busy homes\nUnderlying diseases, such as arthritis\nMale, indoor, and obese cats are more likely to develop stress cystitis.\nOlder cats are more at risk of age-related insecurity: this often appears as excessive noise during the night and house soiling.\n\nHow is stress diagnosed in cats\n\nWith any change in behaviour, sudden or gradual, it is best to contact your vet. This is especially urgent if there is physical illness present. Your vet will usually start by investigating potential medical causes. This may include\n\nA clinical examination to check for any abnormalities, including pain\nBlood tests\nUrine tests\nSkin tests, such as a biopsy\nImaging: X-rays or ultrasound\n\n¬†\n\nCertain medical conditions can occur or worsen as a result of stress\n\nOvergrooming and skin problems\nUrinary issues: Stress or Interstitial Cystitis\nCat flu\n\nFurther tests may be needed if your cat has these symptoms.\n\nUrinary issues are often related to stress\nOvergrooming is a sign of stress\n\nOnce medical conditions have been investigated, the next step is to address behavioural causes. It‚Äôs best to speak with a behavioural specialist to help identify underlying causes. They will create a specific plan for your cat‚Äôs individual needs.\n\nBehaviour specialists\nReferral to a behavioural specialist is always beneficial, especially if aggression is involved.\nWhen looking for a behaviourist, check their accreditations. It is important to find someone suitably qualified who uses ethical and up-to-date techniques.\nYour vet will usually be able to help find a suitable behaviourist, as some only work by referral. See the following organisations for more information about behaviour specialists:\n\nABTC (Animal Behaviour and Training Council) is a regulatory body that sets and maintains standards for the profession and has a national register for appropriately qualified animal trainers and behaviourists: https://abtc.org.uk/practitioners/?_abtc_role=clinical-animal-behaviourist\n\nCCAB (Certified Clinical Animal Behaviourist) ‚Äì an accreditation scheme by the ASAB ( association for the study of animal behaviour): https://www.asab.org/ccab-register\n\nFAB (Fellowship of Animal Behaviour Clinicians) has a list of certified members and promotes high ethical standards and up-to-date techniques: https://fabclinicians.org/find-a-behaviourist/\n\nAPBC (Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors) is a network of experienced and qualified counsellors: https://www.apbc.org.uk/find-an-APBC-member/\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for stress in cats?\n\nTreatment for stress in cats will depend on whether there are any underlying medical concerns.\n\nTreatment of underlying medical conditions\n\nSkin disease may require:\n\nAntibiotics: may be oral, cream, or shampoos\nAnti-itch medications\nParasite preventatives\nFood trials\n\nUrinary tract disease may need:\n\nPain relief, anti-inflammatory medication\nAntibiotics if infection present\nSpecial food for crystals or obesity if present\nIn the case of male cat urinary blockages: emergency hospitalisation for catheterisation, fluids, and pain relief.\n\nCat flu may require:\n\nAnti-inflammatory medication\nEye drops\nAntibiotics\nTreatment of behavioural problems\n\nUsually involves an adaptation plan for at home together with specific behavioural medications.\n\nFinding the underlying cause(s) and adapting to end or reduce this. It may be necessary to seek the help of a behavioural specialist to do this.\nSome cats may need prescription medication to help reduce behavioural problems, such as sedatives or anti-anxiety medications.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help at home if your cat has stress\n\nThere are ways to help at home if your cat is stressed or you expect changes in the routine or environment.¬† A combination of calming supplements, diffusers, and environmental changes can help.\n\nCalming supplements and diffusers\nPheromone adapters, sprays, and wipes. These products release a soothing pheromone into the air that can help reduce stress levels. They only have effects on pets, not humans.\nCalming supplements. These contain natural ingredients that can help ease stress and anxiety.\nBladder supplements can be useful when cystitis is also present.\n\nAlways seek advice from a professional to find the underlying cause of stress. These products should be used alongside a behavioural modification plan. It may take several weeks before you see any improvement.

Keep these resources away from busy or noisy areas of the house.\nProvide multiple options for drinking water, such as a bowl and a fountain, in separate areas.\nFor multi-cat households, at least one resource per cat plus an extra. Feeding separately can also help.\nProvide a safe space for them to hide in the house: somewhere high, warm, and dark is perfect.\nFor elderly or unwell cats, make sure these resources are easily accessible.\n\nKeep a consistent routine for your cat, such as feeding at the same time every day.\n\nProvide adequate playtime for your cat for both mental and physical stimulation. Use puzzle toys or hide treats for them to find.\n\nAnticipate any changes, such as moving house, and take steps in advance to reduce this stress on your cat. Use a pheromone diffuser or book a stay for them at a cattery while there is work in the house.\n\nGradually introduce new pets into the household.\n\nPay attention to your cat‚Äôs body language. Never restrain your cat, and give them space. Some cats prefer not to be touched or patted. Let them come to you. Some cats love attention but try to avoid them becoming over-attached.\n\nIf possible, install a cat flap, ideally with a microchip sensor, for outdoor cats so they can come and go as they want.\n\nMake sure to get your cat checked over regularly, at least 1-2 times a year, by your local vet to check for any illnesses.\n\nWhen you should be worried about a cat with stress\n\nSeek help from your local vet practice:\n\nImmediately if your male cat has any difficulties passing urine\nIf there is any sudden or gradual change in your cat‚Äôs behaviour\nIf your cat is losing weight\n\nCall us and speak to one of our Joii Vets if\n\nYou think your cat may be stressed.\nYou are anticipating changes in your cat‚Äôs routine and want to know how to prevent stress for your cat.\nYou want to know more about different supplements or diffusers to help with stress.\nYou need advice about what toys or treats to use for mental and physical stimulation for your cat.\nYou are not sure what key resources your cat needs.\nYou have any questions about finding an appropriate behaviour specialist.\n\nWe offer pet well-being and behavioural services through the Joii App ‚Äì call our nurse or vet team to find out more!\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Our Joii team are available 24 hours a day for advice.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of stress in dogs\n\nStress in dogs can lead to emotional and physical illness.\n\nHow to tell if your dog is stressed:\n\nBehavioural signs\nShaking, trembling, or shivering\nRestlessness or pacing\nBarking or whining\nRepeated yawning, drooling, or licking their lips\nExcessive panting\nGoing to the toilet in the house\nSudden aggression\nDestructive behaviour\nChanges in body language\nDilated pupils and blinking faster than normal\nThe whites of the eye are more visible\nEars back and close to the head\nTail tucked under the body, crouching down\n \nPhysical health\nEating and drinking less than normal\nVomiting or¬†Diarrhoea\nPoor coat condition: scruffy or matted\nExcessive shedding, licking themselves, and skin sores\nWeight loss\nEating non-food items, also called PICA\nLow energy, sleeping more than normal\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of stress than others?\n\nAny dog, regardless of age, breed, or sex, can become stressed. Just like humans, dogs are all individuals, and they all react differently to changes in situations.\n\nHowever, some risk factors can lead to stress:\n\nA lack of socialisation as a puppy can lead to fear-related problems in the future\nUnderlying disease, such as pain due to arthritis\nOlder dogs are more at risk of dementia, which can affect anxiety levels\nRescue dogs with pre-existing issues\n\n¬†\n\nHow is stress diagnosed in dogs?\n\nWith any change in behaviour, sudden or gradual, it is best to contact your vet. If there are physical symptoms present too, do this as soon as possible. Your vet will usually start by investigating potential medical causes.\n\nThis may include\n\nA physical examination to check for any abnormalities, including pain\nBlood tests\nUrine tests\nSkin tests, such as a biopsy\nImaging: X-rays or ultrasound\n\nOnce medical conditions have been investigated and ruled out, the next step is to address behavioural causes. It‚Äôs best to speak with a behaviour specialist to help identify underlying causes. They will create a specific plan for your dog‚Äôs individual needs.\n\nBehaviour specialists\nA referral to a behavioural specialist is always beneficial, especially if there is aggression.\nWhen looking for a behaviourist, it‚Äôs important to make sure you check their accreditations. It is extremely important to find someone suitably qualified who uses ethical and up-to-date techniques.\nYour vet will also be able to help you find a suitable behaviourist; many only work with referrals. See the following organisations for more information about behaviour specialists:\n\nABTC (Animal Behaviour and Training Council) is a regulatory body that sets and maintains standards for the profession and has a national register for appropriately qualified animal trainers and behaviourists: https://abtc.org.uk/practitioners/?_abtc_role=clinical-animal-behaviourist\n\nCCAB (Certified Clinical Animal Behaviourist) ‚Äì an accreditation scheme by the ASAB ( association for the study of animal behaviour): https://www.asab.org/ccab-register\n\nFAB (Fellowship of Animal Behaviour Clinicians) has a list of certified members and promotes high ethical standards and up-to-date techniques: https://fabclinicians.org/find-a-behaviourist/\n\nAPBC (Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors) is a network of experienced and qualified counsellors: https://www.apbc.org.uk/find-an-APBC-member/\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for stress in dogs?\n\nTreatment for stress in dogs will depend on whether there are any underlying medical concerns. Medical conditions may require specific medications.\n\nStress colitis\n\nInflammation of the large intestine, caused by stress.\nThis leads to diarrhoea, often with blood and mucus.\nMost dogs will recover within a few days if the cause of the stress is found and removed.\nSome dogs may need a probiotic and gastrointestinal food to help the symptoms clear.\n\nSkin conditions\n\nStress can lead to skin problems due to excessive licking, biting, or overgrooming.\nSometimes they can develop skin sores, rashes, and areas of alopecia due to this.\nTreatment may include anti-itch medication, antibiotics, special shampoos, and parasite control.\nTreatment of behavioural problems\n\nThe treatment will depend on the cause of the stress. It will usually involve an adaptation plan at home along with the use of behavioural medications.\n\nFinding the underlying cause(s) and adapting to stop or reduce this. It is often necessary to seek the help of a behavioural specialist to do this.\nSome dogs may need prescription medication to help reduce behavioural problems, such as sedatives or anti-anxiety medications.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with stress at home\n\nThere are several things you can do at home to help if your dog has been diagnosed with stress-related problems. They can also be helpful if you expect any changes in the environment or routine.\n\nCalming supplements and diffusers\nPheromone adapters, sprays, and wipes. These products release a soothing pheromone into the air that can help reduce stress levels. They only affect pets, not humans.\nCalming supplements. These contain natural ingredients that can help ease stress and anxiety.\nThundershirt and calming dog bed. Have been found to help reduce anxiety.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to seek advice from a professional to find the underlying cause of stress along with using these types of products. They should always be used alongside a behavioural modification plan.

Cats of any age or breed can get tick bites, but cats who go outdoors are at most risk. Ticks can spread a serious illness called Lyme disease.\n\nTicks are the size of tiny seeds when they first latch on to your cat. They stay attached to grow and feed for up to 5 days.

Most often it is due to spinal or tail injuries.\n\nIncontinence is when urine is passed without control.¬† Controlling the passage of urine requires a combination of voluntary actions and involuntary reflexes. Voluntary control can be affected by serious damage to any part of the spine. Reflexes can be affected by damage to nerves near the base of the tail.

It is more common in middle-aged neutered females and usually responds well to treatment. Puppies can have a rare and more serious type of incontinence.\n\nThe most common cause is urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence, where the urethra becomes too weak to stop urine from dripping out of the bladder. In puppies, incontinence is often due to a birth defect called ectopic ureter. Urinary incontinence can also be caused by spinal disease or other nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence in dogs\nWhy is my dog leaking urine?\n\nUrinary incontinence is when urine leaks out without the dog realising it. This usually happens when they are lying down or resting.\n\nIn puppies with ectopic ureter, the urine coming from the kidneys is deposited beyond the bladder, which prevents normal storage and control.\n\nIn adult dogs the muscles controlling the exit to the bladder weaken over time and the position of the bladder may change.\n\nIn neutered animals, hormonal changes play a significant role in the development of incontinence.\n\nIncontinence from spinal or nerve problems usually happens together with other symptoms, such as pain and trouble moving.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence in dogs¬†\n\nSpots or puddles of urine on their bed or where they rest\n\nArea around vulva or penis may be wet\n\nPuppies may dribble urine when standing and moving¬†\n\nSymptoms in puppies may not start until they are fully grown\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of urinary incontinence than others?\n\nThe majority of dogs affected by this condition are neutered females\n\nLarge breeds are more commonly affected, particularly Irish Setters and Boxers\n\nIn puppies, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more commonly affected\n\n¬†\n\nHow is urinary incontinence diagnosed in dogs?\n\nEctopic ureters in puppies can be difficult to diagnose. If size permits, cystoscopy may be ideal. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed through the urethra so the inside can be checked.\n\nOther options include an ultrasound scan, a special type of x-ray or a CT scan.\n\nIn adult dogs, urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence is usually diagnosed by ruling out other causes of incontinence.\n\nA urine test is recommended in all cases to rule out infection and disease in other organs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for urinary incontinence in dogs?\n\nIn puppies, the abnormal urine path must be closed. In many cases, this can be done during cystoscopy. If not, surgery is required.\n\nIn adult dogs, there are medications to improve bladder control. These tend to work well in females but not so much in males.\n\nSome medications, like phenylpropanolamine (Propalin), directly improve the strength of the muscles around the bladder exit.\n\nOther medications, like estriol (Incurin), replace the effects of oestrogen on the urethral muscle.\n\nThese two types of medications can be used together, and this is thought to have additional benefits.\n\nIf not responding to medication, there are surgical procedures that will reduce urine losses by re-positioning the bladder slightly (colposuspension).\n\nIt is also possible to insert an artificial urethral sphincter to control urine flow or inject material into the urethral wall to increase tension.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with urinary incontinence\n\nUrine can be very irritant to the skin.

Unfortunately, when the vestibular system isn‚Äôt working, your cat‚Äôs eyes start to flicker, so they can‚Äôt see properly.

Sometimes your cat needs an anaesthetic so the vet can look inside the ear with a camera, take samples, and clean the ear well.\nIdiopathic vestibular syndrome has no specific cure. Symptoms gradually improve, and around 80% of cats will make a good recovery with nursing care.\nThiamine deficiency: Thiamine injections and medicine by mouth.\nDrug toxicity or poisons: cause is withdrawn and supportive treatment provided.\nBrain inflammation: treatment depends on the particular cause but can include antibiotics, antiviral drugs and steroids.\nPolyps: an operation to remove them.\nCancer: treatment options are limited, but may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and specialist surgery.\n\nCancer and brain inflammation cause more severe vestibular disease. Seizures, weakness and generalised illness are more likely. Vets call this central vestibular disease. Specific symptoms depend on the cause or parts of the brain affected.

But if your cat picks up on your anxiety, it‚Äôll make things worse.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with vestibular disease\n\nMost cats with idiopathic vestibular disease recover completely within a few days. Sometimes recovery takes longer, and your cat may be left with a mild deficit, like a head tilt. If your cat still has a head tilt after 6 months, this is likely to be permanent.\n\nMost cats adapt well over time to mild deficits, but they may need some help with feeding or mobility:\n\nKeep food bowls at ground level and easy to get to if your cat struggles with balance.\nDon‚Äôt let your cat go up or down stairs unsupervised.

In most cases, they get better on their own or with supportive management.\n\nWhen cats eat grass, bugs, or their own fur, they can be sick afterward. This is not normally a reason for concern, and they can be cared for at home. Sometimes they may have diarrhoea too. We call this gastroenteritis.

Please take your cat to see a vet as soon as possible.\nCat sick, undigested food.\nCat sick, white foam.\nCat sick, bile with blood. Your cat should be seen by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat a vomiting cat at home\nHome remedies for cats who are being sick\n\nIf your cat has been sick a couple of times but is otherwise bright and well, it‚Äôs important to:\n\nNot let them eat for 2-3 hours after vomiting. Let their stomach rest and recover.\nAllow access to fresh water\nEncourage them to drink and stay hydrated:\nOffer rehydration solutions especially made for animals\nor the water from a tin of tuna in spring water\nIf they don‚Äôt vomit again, feed a teaspoon of bland, low-fat food every 2-3 hours for the first 24 hours. Then increase the amount and reduce the frequency for the next 2-3 days. We recommend:\nPlain boiled chicken or white fish\nPrescription commercial food for gastrointestinal problems, such as Hill‚Äôs Prescription Diet i/d\nDo a slow transition from bland or prescription food to normal food over at least 4-5 days.\n\n¬†\n\nHow a vet will treat your vomiting cat in practice\n\nYour vet will ask you lots of questions and examine your cat to figure out why they are being sick. They may suggest blood and urine tests, an X-ray or an ultrasound.\n\nYour vet will give medications to help with the vomiting, such as:\n\nAnti-sickness medication\nStomach protectants\nAnti-acid medication\nAntibiotics and pain relief or other more specific medication, depending on the cause and if necessary\n\nIf your cat is not well and is getting dehydrated, they may need to stay in the practice and have fluids given on a drip.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of vomiting?\nAny cat of any age can develop vomiting.\nOutdoor cats are at higher risk of vomiting as they are more likely to eat something they shouldn‚Äôt.\nYounger cats and kittens are more likely to eat foreign bodies and toxins/poisons.\nCats that are not vaccinated or wormed are at higher risk of infections.\nBurmese and Siamese cats under the age of one year are at higher risk of intussusception.\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of vomiting in cats\n\nVomiting is often caused by irritation of the lining of the stomach and/or intestines.

They may also ask to run blood and urine tests, take x-rays or carry out an ultrasound scan on their tummy.\n\nTreatments can include:\n\nAnti-sickness medication\nStomach protectants\nAnti-acid medication\nFluids on a drip if they are really poorly and dehydrated\nSurgery: to find out what the problem is, fix their stomach or remove any foreign objects that may be stuck.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of vomiting than others?\nAny dog of any age can develop vomiting.\nDogs that eat things when they are out on walks, human food scraps, or have sudden changes in diet are at a higher risk.\nCertain breeds like French Bulldogs, Labradoodles, and Cockapoos are more prone to food intolerances.\nPuppies and young dogs are more likely to eat foreign bodies.\nOlder dogs are at a higher risk of developing general illnesses related to the liver, kidneys, or pancreas, or have tumours.\nScavengers are more likely to eat something toxic.\nDogs of large breeds or with a deep chest are more prone to develop twisted stomachs.\nDogs on long-term medication may be more likely to have ulcers or suffer from kidney or liver toxicity.\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of vomiting in dogs\n\nVomiting in dogs is a very unspecific sign, and it can be a symptom of many different conditions, such as:\n\nCar or motion sickness: some dogs don‚Äôt cope well when in the car and may vomit. They normally recover quickly once out of the car. Speak to your vet to get preventative treatment for this if you have to take your dog on a long car journey. Speak to an animal behaviourist if you want to train your dog to not feel sick in the car.\nMorning sickness: some dogs suffer from reflux when they have long periods between meals, and may bring up bright yellow liquid, especially in the morning. Making sure that your dog doesn‚Äôt go longer than 12 hours between their meals overnight may help reduce the frequency of morning sickness.\nTwisted stomach, or GDV (Gastric Dilation Volvulus)\nIllnesses of other organs:\nLiver: liver failure, hepatitis, gallbladder problems, tumours\nKidneys: chronic kidney disease, kidney infection, kidney failure, tumours, kidney stones\nPancreas: pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\nUterus: pyometra (infection inside the uterus)\nProstate: abscess\nPeritonitis: infection inside their tummy\nSevere infections in other parts of the body ‚Äì Sepsis\nUlcers in the stomach\nTumours\nMetabolic diseases:\nKetoacidotic diabetes mellitus\nHypoadrenocorticism or Addison‚Äôs disease\nBacterial infections in their stomach or gut:\nCampylobacter\nSalmonella\nLeptospirosis\nViral infections:\nRotavirus\nParvovirus\nDistemper\nCoronavirus\nSevere intestinal parasitic infestations:\nRoundworms\nHookworms\nHeartworms\nTapeworms\nWhipworms\nTrauma\n\n¬†\n\n 2 3\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

These are more common in older cats but can happen at any age. In cats, more than 50% of skin tumours are cancerous, so a vet check is always recommended.\n\nThere are different types of skin growths that can look like warts in cats. Like with many other species, a common cause is a papillomavirus. Sadly, in cats, the body doesn‚Äôt often clear the growth, and in many cases, it will become cancerous over time. Early treatment is more likely to work, and surgery is the best option currently available.\n\n\nWhere do warts on cats come from?¬†\n\nWarts can be caused by a virus or by skin cells growing abnormally. Cats can also get many different types of skin growths. These can come from normal skin cells growing out of control and losing their normal function. They should always be checked by a vet.\n\n\n¬†What do warts look like?\n\nWarts on the skin can look like:\n\nExtra skin growing out¬†\nAn irregular disk on the skin¬†\nA crusty bit of skin¬†\n\nOther symptoms can be associated with the wart:\n\nRedness of the nearby skin\nItching or tenderness\nDischarge\nWeight loss\nLethargy\n\nCats at higher risk of developing warts\n\nWhite or hairless cats are at higher risk for skin tumours, especially if they spend a lot of time in the sun. This is especially true for cancerous tumours.\n\nCan I catch or pass warts to my cat?\n\nDespite many species having warts caused by papillomavirus, each virus will usually only cause them in a specific species. A papillomavirus from a cat cannot grow on human skin, and vice-versa. They can be contagious to other cats but this doesn‚Äôt happen often.\n\n\nDiagnosis of skin warts in cats\n\nYou can‚Äôt tell what a skin lump is just from how it looks, but irregular, irritated and fast-growing lumps are more concerning\n\nScratching a small sample from a lump using a needle, called a fine needle aspirate, is often useful. However, it may provide limited information and does not work at all for some lumps\n\nA final diagnosis requires a biopsy. This is where a part, or all, of the lump is removed during surgery and sent to the lab for analysis¬†\n\nOther tests (x-rays, ultrasound, and immunofluorescence) may be needed if cancer is suspected.\n\n\nTreatment of warts¬†\n\nSurgery may be the only treatment needed if the lump is not cancerous or is caught early\n\nOther treatment options (Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy) depend on the exact type of tumour present.¬†\n\nIf the wart looks sore, gentle cleaning and a mild antiseptic may help prevent infection while you wait to see the vet.\n\n\nCan I treat my cat‚Äôs wart at home?\n\nAs previously mentioned, many warts and skin growths in cats will be cancerous. You should not delay veterinary treatment. Trying to remove these at home may cause your cat unnecessary suffering, infection or even help the tumour spread.\n\n\nWhen to worry about a wart on your cat\n\nAlways have skin growths on your cat checked by a vet, most likely, they will need to be tested.¬†\n\nSeek help from a vet if your cat has a wart that:\n\nhas grown very quickly\nIs bleeding\nIs painful\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYou found a lump on your cat‚Äôs skin and want to have it checked\nYou are worried about your cat‚Äôs warts and want to discuss options\nYour cat‚Äôs wart is causing your cat to be mildly uncomfortable\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

There are two types of warts that commonly appear in dogs, one that affects puppies and another more common in older dogs.¬†\n\nSkin tags or lumps that look like warts are usually caused by a Papillomavirus. Puppies will develop small cauliflower-like growths on their lips or gums, often in small groups. Older dogs develop small tags on their skin anywhere in their body. In both cases, the growths tend to be small and usually disappear after several weeks. There are other types of skin growths that can look like warts, especially on the eyelids.¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†What causes warts in dogs\n\nThere are many types of papillomavirus and they are very common. If skin defences are disrupted, a dog papillomavirus can break in and infect skin cells. This causes these cells to grow abnormally and results in a wart\n\nPuppies tend to get warts on their gums. Their immature defences allow the virus to settle in without a previous injury. The virus causing these is the same\n\nSome skin tumours can initially look like warts, but these can be a lot more serious.\n\nSymptoms of warts in dogs\n\nThe most obvious symptom is obviously the wart itself, but sometimes you can also see:\n\nRedness\nSwelling\nItching\nBleeding\nDischarge\n\nThese symptoms should be discussed with a vet as they may point to a more serious problem or complication.\n\nDogs at higher risk of developing warts\n\nPuppies tend to have bigger warts and are much more likely to have multiple warts.\n\nDogs with a weak immune system, due to disease or treatment for other conditions.\n\nDogs that have previously had skin cancer are at higher risk of something more serious.\n\nCan I catch warts from my dog? How about my other pets?\n\nHumans cannot catch warts from dogs. The dog papillomavirus can only affect dogs, so cats and other furries are also safe. It can spread between dogs, but only causes warts if the skin is damaged. No extra precautions are usually recommended to prevent spread.\n\nHow to know if a dog‚Äôs wart is serious\n\nYour vet may suspect a Papilloma-type wart after visual examination and recommend monitoring\n\nIf the diagnosis isn‚Äôt clear, especially if there is inflammation or discomfort, your vet may try to take a¬† sample with a needle to examine under the microscope. This is called a Fine Needle Aspirate or FNA.\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt enough, a biopsy may be required.\n\nHow to treat warts in dogs\n\nMouth warts in puppies will disappear after 4-8 weeks. If there are a lot of them, or they are large, they can cause issues with eating or get infected. Such cases may need treatment with antibiotics or anti-inflammatories. Very severe cases may need to be treated with a specially-prepared vaccine.\n\nSkin warts on older dogs will often disappear as well. If the wart is getting traumatised or if there are any concerns, it can be removed surgically.\n\nCryosurgery uses extremely cold liquid to freeze a lump in place and then remove it with minimal bleeding. This is an option in some practices but requires special equipment and knowledge.¬†\n\nRemoval of warts should always be done professionally. Using unlicensed ointments or procedures at home can damage the skin and cause serious complications.\n\nWhat should I do about my dog‚Äôs warts?\n\nAny growths or lumps should be examined by a vet. If your vet recommends monitoring, it may help if you measure a lump every 1-2 weeks and check it every couple of days.\n\nTrying to remove warts at home may cause unnecessary suffering, infection or even help them spread.\n\nWhen to worry about a wart on my dog\n\nA vet check may be urgent¬† if:\n\nThe wart becomes red and inflamed\nThere is swelling or discharge\nThe area becomes painful or itchy\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Most cats will pick up worms at some point in their lives, but untreated cats, kittens and cats who hunt are most at risk.\n\nDifferent types of worms live in different parts of the body. They cause health problems which range from mild to life-threatening and the illnesses they cause depend on their location. You can protect your cat against the risk of worms with regular preventive treatment using an effective wormer. Different wormers may be required for different types of worms.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do I know if my cat has worms?\n\nTwo types of worms are most common in cats ‚Äì roundworms and tapeworms. Lungworms, hookworms and whipworms also occur in the UK, but are uncommon in cats.\n\n¬†\n\nRoundworms and tapeworms\n\nThey live in your cat‚Äôs intestines. They might not cause any symptoms at all, so you don‚Äôt always know if your cat has worms.\n\nRoundworms can grow up to 15 cm long in cats. And even small types of tapeworms reach 50cm.\n\nTapeworms are like long ribbons made up of lots of tiny individual segments. Each segment contains between 30.000 and 1.000.000 eggs. They break off from the adult worm and pass out through your cat‚Äôs bottom in poo.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of worms in cats\n\nEvidence your cat has intestinal worms includes:\n\nExcessive grooming under their tail, possibly causing hair loss.\nSpaghetti-like roundworms in poo or vomit\nSmall white things in poo that look like grains of rice are tapeworm segments\nTapeworm segments may also be stuck in the hair around your cat‚Äôs bottom and tail\n\n¬†\n\nIntestinal worms\n\nIntestinal worms steal your cat‚Äôs food and stop them gaining or maintaining weight.

The risk of a dog encountering a lungworm host is therefore high.\nOnly snails and slugs carry infectious late-stage larvae. When a dog (or fox) eats a snail or slug (either on purpose or accidentally), the larvae migrate from the intestines through the liver and into the bloodstream. They then reach the heart, where they mature into adults. There they breed, and their eggs hatch into larvae which enter the airways. From the lungs, the larvae are coughed up, swallowed, and pass out of the body in poo. There they can infect passing slugs and snails.\n\nSlime trails can also contain larvae, making anything the snail or slug has crawled over a risk. This includes bowls, toys and grass, which a dog may eat. Young dogs may be more at risk, purely because they may be more curious.\n\nAlthough a dog can‚Äôt catch lungworm directly from another dog or fox, an infected fox (or dog) in the area can infect local snails and slugs, thus increasing the risk for everyone in the locality.\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Cats of any age, sex or breed can get Addison‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs more likely in middle-aged cats.\n\nAddison‚Äôs, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, happens when your cat‚Äôs adrenal glands are damaged and don‚Äôt produce enough steroid hormone. Steroid hormones play essential roles in all animals‚Äô bodies. In the early stages of Addison‚Äôs disease, the condition is very hard to recognise because the symptoms are vague, intermittent and can be mistaken for other illnesses. Addison‚Äôs can‚Äôt be cured, but it can be treated successfully for life. Unfortunately, if the condition isn‚Äôt identified and effectively controlled, it can lead to an emergency called an ‚ÄòAddisonian crisis‚Äô, and even death.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Addison‚Äôs disease in cats?\n\nAddison‚Äôs is a disease of the adrenal glands. These are two small structures in your cat‚Äôs tummy near their kidneys. The adrenal glands produce two steroid hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. Your cat depends on these hormones for many essential functions in their body. The symptoms of Addison‚Äôs develop when levels of these hormones in your cat‚Äôs bloodstream fall to abnormally low levels.\n\nHow does Addison‚Äôs disease develop?\n\n‚¶Å Your cat‚Äôs adrenal glands get damaged\n\n‚¶Å Cortisol and aldosterone levels fall to dangerously low levels\n\n‚¶Å Many of your cat‚Äôs cells and body systems stop working properly\n\n‚¶Å Vague signs of illness develop\n\n‚¶Å Vital organs such as heart and kidneys may fail if the condition is not recognised and treated\n\nThe adrenal glands can be damaged by the body‚Äôs own defence cells. Sometimes the body stops recognising its own tissues and attacks them. This is called an autoimmune disease and it‚Äôs the most common cause of Addison‚Äôs disease in cats. We don‚Äôt know for certain why this happens. It may be caused by a faulty gene.\n\nAnatomical location of the pituitary gland and the adrenal glands in cats.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of Addison‚Äôs disease in cats\n\nSymptoms of Addison‚Äôs in cats are vague in the early stages. They may happen on and off over many months.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nPoor appetite\nVomiting\nWeakness and low energy (lethargy)\nWeight loss\nDrinking more and urinating (peeing) more\n‚ÄúJust not right‚Äù\n\nThe main symptom of an Addisonian crisis is collapse.\n\nOther symptoms of an Addisonian crisis include:\n\nWeakness\nAbdominal pain\nPale gums\nSlow heartbeat and breathing\nCold feet and ears\nLoss of consciousness\n\nIf your cat has collapsed, call your nearest vet practice as soon as possible.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of Addison‚Äôs than others?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease in cats is extremely rare. Only around 50 cases have been officially recorded since it was first documented in cats in 1983.\n\nCats of any age, sex or breed can get Addison‚Äôs Disease. It‚Äôs most likely to happen in middle age.\n\nAddison‚Äôs Disease is not dangerous to human family members or to other pets in the house.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose Addison‚Äôs disease in cats?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the symptoms come and go and can be confused with much more common illnesses.\n\nVets diagnose Addison‚Äôs disease through:\n\nsymptoms\nurine tests\nblood tests\ngeneral blood tests: checking liver, kidneys, electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and inflammation\nspecific blood tests:¬† to check your cat‚Äôs steroid hormone production\nan ECG to check your cat‚Äôs heart\nan ultrasound scan of your cat‚Äôs tummy to examine the adrenal glands in more detail\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is often only identified when your cat is admitted to a vet practice or hospital because of severe dehydration or collapse.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for Addison‚Äôs disease in cats\n\nThere‚Äôs no cure for Addison‚Äôs disease.\n\nOnce your cat has been diagnosed, they will need treatment for the rest of their lives.\n\nEmergency treatment for acute (sudden) Addison‚Äôs disease\nFluids given directly into your cat‚Äôs veins for rehydration\nCorrection of sodium and potassium levels in the bloodstream\nEmergency steroid injections to replace essential cortisol\nLongterm treatment for Addison‚Äôs disease\nmonthly injections to replace the hormone aldosterone\ndaily tablets to replace the hormone cortisol (see footnote)\n\nCortisol is a hormone that helps your cat‚Äôs body deal with stress. Without this hormone, anything that stresses your cat may trigger more severe symptoms. This can be overcome by increasing your cat‚Äôs daily dose of steroid tablets during stressful events, such as family gatherings, holidays or if they get another illness.\n\nOnce stabilised on treatment, your cat will continue to need regular checkups with a vet, including blood tests once or twice a year.\n\nThe good news is that most cats respond well to treatment and go on to live full and happy lives.\n\nSadly, some cats respond poorly to treatment, particularly those who have other illnesses at the same time as Addison‚Äôs disease. For cats whose Addison‚Äôs disease cannot be safely and effectively controlled, it may be kinder to end their lives peacefully through euthanasia.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with Addison‚Äôs disease at home\n\nAddison‚Äôs Disease in cats is a serious and complicated disease.\n\nThere are no home remedies to treat Addison‚Äôs disease.\n\nIf your cat has Addison‚Äôs disease, they must have.\n\n¬†prescription medicine from a vet.\n¬†regular check-ups at a vet practice.\n\nFollowing your vet‚Äôs advice will help to ensure your pet can continue their recovery in familiar surroundings at home and reduce the likelihood of expensive vet bills for hospital stays.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat who has Addison‚Äôs disease\n\nAddison‚Äôs cats can‚Äôt produce their own cortisol to cope with stress. So even cats on treatment can become unwell if they experience a new or stressful situation. This includes:\n\ntrips to the vets\ngoing on holiday or into kennels\nvisitors in the house\n\nBut stressful events can also include things which are maybe not as obvious. For example:\n\nchanges in diet\nchanges in routines, including household movements and numbers.\nloss of familiar toys\nother illnesses\n\nSome of these potential stressors can be controlled or avoided altogether by:\n\nkeeping to a suitable diet\nbeing consistent with times for meals and bed\navoiding swapping out favourite toys (and keeping a supply of identical ones, just in case)\nKeeping a close eye on your cat‚Äôs health and responding promptly to any changes\n\nOften, the most stressful things can‚Äôt be prevented or even predicted. This may be unexpected travel or your cat becoming unwell for another reason. In those cases, your cat may need a slightly bigger dose of their daily steroid tablet.\n\nFor your cat‚Äôs safety, any changes to their regular medication should only be carried out under the supervision and guidance of a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nCan Addison‚Äôs in cats be prevented?\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease is a rare condition.

It affects around 1 in 1000 dogs in the UK. Although dogs of any age, sex or breed can get Addison‚Äôs, it‚Äôs more likely in adult females and in certain breeds.\n\nAddison‚Äôs disease, also called hypoadrenocorticism, happens when your dog‚Äôs adrenal glands are damaged and don‚Äôt produce enough steroid hormone. Steroid hormones play essential roles in all animals‚Äô bodies. In the early stages of Addison‚Äôs disease, the condition is very hard to recognise. The symptoms are vague, intermittent and can be mistaken for other illnesses. Addison‚Äôs disease can‚Äôt be cured, but it can be treated successfully for life.

Cats rarely experience limping, as seen in dogs. Instead, they will typically exhibit changes in behaviour, activity levels, and routines. Arthritis in cats has been proven to be very common, especially in those older than 12 years.\n\nArthritis is irreversible and causes progressive deterioration of the joints, leading to pain, inflammation, and stiffness. Arthritis is also called osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease (DJD). There are many different medications for the treatment of arthritis and also other options such as alternative therapies and surgery. The key is to assess and adapt treatment plans regularly.\n\nWhat is arthritis in cats?\n\nArthritis simply means ‚Äúinflammation of the joints‚Äù.\n\nThe most common type of arthritis in cats is osteoarthritis. Other types include rheumatoid arthritis and septic arthritis, which is caused by joint infection.\n\nArthritis is a complex condition that affects not only the cartilage but all the structures within the joint. If left unmanaged, it can lead to complete joint failure. Arthritis can affect any joint and may affect multiple joints.\n\nIt is a very common condition in cats and in many cases is associated with significant life-long pain. It is often difficult to detect the signs of arthritis in cats due to the difficulty in recognizing the symptoms.\n\nArthritis can cause a change in lifestyle, behaviour and activity levels (such as reluctance to jump and groom).\n\nIt is a progressive disease, meaning it gets slowly worse over time.\n\nHow does a cat get arthritis?\n\nThere is no single cause of arthritis. Many factors play a role, including:\n\nBody conformation (how a cat is built)\nBeing overweight\nAbnormal joint development (e.g. hip dysplasia)\nActivity history\nPrevious injuries\nOrthopaedic surgery\nNutritional history\n\nMost cats with arthritis experience a combination of these factors as their condition develops and progresses. We now know that just ‚Äògetting old‚Äô is not a cause of arthritis.\n\nHow to identify the signs of arthritis in cats\n\nCats are incredible at ‚Äòcoping‚Äô with discomfort. Which makes detecting it difficult.¬†These are possible signs of arthritis and chronic pain in cats:\n\n¬†\n\nMobility changes\nnot jumping up or down\nsize or height of the jump\ngracefulness\nchanges in toileting\n\n¬†\n\nActivity levels\nsleeping more\nplaying and hunting less\n\n¬†\n\nGrooming habits\ndull or matted coat condition\nchange in scratching behaviours\n\n¬†\n\nTemperament\nreduced tolerance to the owner or other animals\nchange in the general attitude\n\nCan any cat develop arthritis?\n\nAny cat can develop arthritis, but those that may be more prone to arthritis are:\n\nCats with known developmental joint problems, commonly seen in breeds such as Maine Coon, Persian, Burmese, Himalayan breeds, Scottish Fold.\n\nOverweight¬†cats.\n\nCats who have¬†had previous surgery on a joint.\n\nAn¬†injured or traumatised¬†joint.\n\nHow is arthritis in cats diagnosed?\n\nTo help determine whether your cat has arthritis, your vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your cat‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\n\nAdditional tests to rule out other conditions might be recommended by your vet:\n\nBlood tests\nUrine test\nChecking thyroid levels\nJoint aspirate and cytology\nOccasionally MRI or a CT scan\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for a cat with arthritis?¬†\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for arthritis, but through careful management, we can give cats comfortable and happy lives.\n\nTreatment options can include one or more of the following:\n\nMedications\nComplementary and alternative therapies\nSurgery\nIntra articular treatments\n\n¬†\n\nMedications for a cat with arthritis\n\nA combination of treatments is recognized as the best way to control pain with minimal side effects and to protect kidneys and liver.\n\nMedication commonly used includes:\n\nAnti-Inflammatory medications\nSolensia\nGabapentin\nAmantadine\nAmitriptyline\nTramadol\n\nDo not use medication for humans as these can be fatal to cats.¬†Seek professional advice from a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies¬†for a cat with arthritis\n\nComplementary and alternative therapies are often used alongside conventional treatment to help control arthritis symptoms. The various options are below.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬†The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nChiropathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP),¬†British Veterinary Chiropractic Association (BVCA)\nOsteopathy:¬†The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), European Veterinary Society for Osteopathy (EVSO)\nLaser therapy\nAcupuncture:¬†Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\nMagnetic field therapy\nMassage\nHomeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\nElectrohydraulic shockwave therapy\n\n¬†\n\nSurgery for a cat with arthritis\n\nThe surgical approach to managing arthritis in cats can be simplified into 3 main categories:\n\nPreventative surgery: aims to delay the onset of arthritis due to abnormal joints or a damaged joint.\n\nStabilising surgery: aims to slow the progression or control the pain of arthritis. A good example is surgery that aims to improve the stability lost in a cranial cruciate ligament rupture (a disease of the knee).\n\nSalvage surgery: aims to improve the dog‚Äôs signs and not to preserve the joint.¬† An example is a total hip replacement or a femoral head excision surgery for hip arthritis.\n\n¬†\n\nIntra-articular treatments for a cat with arthritis\n\nManaging the disease through injections in the joint. The most common intra-articular injection is Stem cells.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still incomplete scientific work to encourage the use of these treatments more commonly.\n\nWhat role do you play in your cat‚Äôs arthritis care?\nHome treatments for cats with arthritis\n\nAs part of your vet‚Äôs treatment plan, it is often advised that you introduce one or more of the following:\n\nHome environment adaptations\nKeep your cat slim\nDiet and nutrition\nSupplements\n\n¬†\n\nHome environment adaptations for a cat with arthritis\n\nFeatures within a home or environment can positively or negatively affect your cat‚Äôs ability to move safely and independently.\n\nYou can improve your cat‚Äôs quality of life with these adaptations:\n\nProvide steps or ramps to ease access to furniture.\nFind a large litter tray with chamfered edges that is easily accessible.\nProvide a comfortable bed.\nPlace the litter boxes, food and dishes, and favourite beds on a single level of the home.\nEncourage mental stimulation. Interact and play with your cat. Provide at least three sessions per day and several minutes for each session. Holding, grooming, or stroking your cat, particularly around the head, releases chemicals that improve their mood and ability to cope with chronic pain.\nPheromone therapy. There is evidence that therapy with pheromones (chemical signals that animals naturally release and detect) can reduce the impact of a stressful environment. There are products available that contain feline facial pheromones. Make sure you get professional advice before you buy something like this.\n\n¬†\n\nWeight management of cats with arthritis\n\nA healthy weight will relieve stress on the joints and is important for minimizing pain. It can also help slow down the progression of the disease.\n\nThe best way to assess your cat is to look at its shape.\n\nGive your cat a ‚Äòbody condition score‚Äô using the body condition score chart.\n\nIt can be very hard for a cat to lose weight.

This is a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff. It affects 80% of dogs over the age of 8 years old, and potentially up to 35% of dogs of all ages.\n\nArthritis is irreversible and causes progressive deterioration of the joints, leading to pain, inflammation and decreased function. Arthritis is also called osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease (DJD). There are many different medications for the treatment of arthritis and also other options such as alternative therapies and surgery, but the key is to assess and adapt treatment plans regularly.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is arthritis in dogs?\n\nArthritis simply means ‚Äúinflammation of the joints‚Äù.\n\nThe most common type of arthritis in dogs is osteoarthritis. Other types include rheumatoid arthritis and septic arthritis, which is caused by joint infection.\n\nArthritis is a complex condition that affects not only the cartilage but all of the structures within the joint, and if left unmanaged, it can lead to complete joint failure.\n\nArthritis can affect any joint and may affect multiple joints.\n\nIt is a very common condition that causes stiffness, pain, and swollen joints.\n\nArthritis makes moving around difficult and uncomfortable.\n\nArthritis is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse slowly over time.\n\nHow does a dog get arthritis?\n\nThere is no single cause of arthritis. Many factors play a role, including:\n\nBody shape or conformation (how a dog is built)\nBeing overweight\nAbnormal joint development (e.g. hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, luxating patellas)\nActivity history\nPrevious injuries (e.g. past fracture, ligament damage, muscle injury, joint infection)\nOrthopaedic surgery\nNutritional history\n\nMost dogs with arthritis experience a combination of these factors as their condition develops and progresses.

The health problems seen in cats with brachycephalic syndrome are different from the ones seen in dogs.\n\nBOAS stands for brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome but can also be called brachycephalic respiratory syndrome. Brachycephalic cats have compacted skeletons that change the shape of their noses, throat, and other body parts. Breathing difficulties are the most common problems that can result from these abnormalities compromising the health and welfare of the cat. As such, severely flat-faced cats should not be bred.\n\nBOAS cat face shape\n\nWhat is BOAS in a cat?\n\nBOAS is a combination of signs that impair breathing seen in flat-faced (brachycephalic) breeds of cats.\n\nBOAS is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in dogs, but less so in cats.\n\nWhen present, it is a lifelong progressive disorder, meaning that it will get worse with time.\n\nThese anatomical changes that affect short-nose cats impair airflow through the upper airways (nose, mouth, voice box) and windpipe and contribute to persistent eye discharge.\n\nCats with brachycephalic syndrome may have:\n\nRespiratory problems\nNarrowed nostrils\nCompacted nasal cavities and short nose\nBigger nasopharyngeal turbinates (ridges of bones in the nose covered by tissue)\nOverlong soft palate\nA tongue that is too big for their mouth, acting as an obstructive barrier to airflow\nNarrow windpipe\nThroat problems\nEye problems\nProtruding eyes with reduced lid closure\nPersistent eye discharge due to blocked tear ducts\nDental/mouth problems\nTeeth are not aligned properly when the jaws are closed, leading to dental disease\nExcessive skin\nExcessive skin folds on the face contribute to narrower nostrils and make them prone to skin infections\n\n¬†\n\nThe symptoms of BOAS can be subtle, but the condition can be very serious.\n\nIt is very important that you discuss the severity of your cat‚Äôs facial conformation and any symptoms that you have noticed with a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of BOAS in cats\n\nThe signs of BOAS are varied and can range in severity, including some or all of the following:\n\nDifficulty breathing\nLoud, raspy respiratory sounds\nSnorting\nSnoring\nNasal discharge\nSneezing\nWorsening signs in hot or humid weather\nEye discharge\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of BOAS than others?\n\nHaving severe breathing problems can be life-threatening. The higher the risk factor, the shorter your cat‚Äôs life expectancy.\n\nThe main risk factors are:\n\nBeing a brachycephalic breed: Persian, Himalayan, and exotic short-hair.\nThe severity of the physical defects\nBeing overweight\nOlder age\nNormal cat head shape on top. BOAS cat head shape at the bottom.\n\nHow will my vet know if my cat has BOAS?\n\nYour vet will assess your cat‚Äôs facial shape and behaviour in certain circumstances. They will also carry out:\n\nPhysical and visual examinations\nHeavy sedation or full anaesthesia\nRhinoscopy (exam of the inside of the nose)\nX-rays and/or CT scans\n\n¬†\n\nWhat treatment options are available for BOAS in cats?\n\nThe main treatments include¬†weight control¬†and¬†surgery.\n\nWill your cat need BOAS surgery?\n\nSurgical procedures can include:\n\nWidening of the nostrils\nReducing the length of the soft palate\nRemoving excessive and/or everted laryngeal tissue\n\nYour veterinarian might recommend one or more of the above, based on your cat‚Äôs specific needs. In some cases, referral to a board-certified surgeon is recommended.\n\nEven with surgery, brachycephalic animals‚Äô airways will never be completely normal.\n\nAre there any medical treatment options for cats with BOAS?\nWeight control\nMedication to reduce inflammation\nAntibiotics to treat secondary respiratory infections\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your cat with BOAS at home?\nKeep your cat slim: Monitor their food and body condition score (BCS). Carrying extra weight will make any breathing problems worse.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\n\n¬†\n\nDuring hot/humid weather: Keep your cat indoors with air conditioning, when possible, and restrict exercise.\nReduce any respiratory irritants in the home, such as smoke, dust, mould and potentially air fresheners.\nReduce stress: Cats are very sensitive to stress, which can lead to a worsening of their BOAS signs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the overall outlook for your cat?\n\nThe prognosis for cats with BOAS depends on how many physical problems are present and how old your cat is at the time of diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTo maintain quality of life, vet visits should be done regularly to monitor new symptoms or to see if any worsen.\n\n¬†\n\nHow can you prevent or minimize the signs of BOAS in cats?\n\nResponsible breeding:¬†cats with significant breathing difficulty or those that need surgery should not be used for breeding.¬†It is usually recommended that these animals be neutered at the same time that surgical correction is performed.\n\nOngoing care: to reduce the severity and frequency of BOAS symptoms follow the previous recommendations on diet, exercise, and environmental modifications.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry if your cat has BOAS?\n\nSeek immediate assistance from an¬†emergency vet practice¬†if your cat:\n\nStruggles to breathe or is open-mouth breathing (cats do not pant, this is an emergency)\nGums become blue or grey\nCollapses\n\nAt¬†Joii¬†we can help:\n\nIf you are thinking about getting a flat-faced breed cat\nAssess your cat‚Äôs weight or help them lose it\nCheck if your cat has any symptoms of BOAS\n\n¬†\n\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Their snuffly breathing is often considered normal but is actually a sign that they are struggling to breathe.\n\nBOAS stands for brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome but can also be called brachycephalic respiratory syndrome. BOAS refers to a group of conditions caused by abnormalities in the body that can often result in breathing difficulties and other problems. Early diagnosis is extremely important. If your dog is showing signs of BOAS, it is best to discuss this with a vet as soon as possible.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is BOAS in dogs?\n\nBOAS is a combination of signs that impair breathing and is seen in flat-faced (brachycephalic) breeds.\n\nBOAS is a lifelong, and often progressive disorder, meaning that it will get worse with time.\n\nThe physical changes seen in these dogs mostly affect the airflow through the upper airways. These include the nose, mouth, throat and windpipe.\n\nThe physical changes seen in dogs with brachycephalic syndrome are:\n\nNarrowed nostrils\nCompacted nasal cavities and a short nose\nOverlong soft palate (which contributes to ‚Äúsnoring‚Äù noises when they breathe)\nA tongue that is too big for their shortened head\nA narrow trachea\nThroat problems\n\nIt is possible for your pet to suffer from one or more of these problems, which can result in different degrees of obstruction.\n\nNarrow nostrils\nCrowded nose and throat\nOverlong soft palate\nNarrow windpipe\n\n¬†\n\nDue to these features, these dogs ‚Äúpull‚Äù harder when they breathe in. This creates a strong negative pressure in their throats, necks, and chests. And this leads to additional respiratory and digestive problems, like vomiting.\n\nSpeak to a vet about your dog‚Äôs nose shape and discuss any symptoms. Early diagnosis has a big impact on your dog‚Äôs quality of life and life span.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of BOAS in dogs\n\nThe signs of BOAS are varied and can range in severity, including some or all of the following:\n\nDifficulty breathing\nLoud, raspy respiratory sounds\nExcessive panting\nSnorting\nSnoring\nCoughing\nGagging or retching\nDifficulty exercising\nCollapse\nWorsening signs in hot or humid weather\nVomiting and regurgitation\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of BOAS than others?\n\nSevere breathing problems can be life-threatening.\n\nThere are four main risk factors:\n\nBrachycephalic breeds, including English and French Bulldogs, Boxers, Pugs, Shih-Tzus, Pekingese, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Dogue de Bordeaux, and Chow Chow.\nThe severity of the physical defects.\nBeing overweight or obese.\nOlder age.\nDifference between the head shape of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù dog (top) and a brachycephalic breed (bottom).\n\n¬†\n\nHow will your vet know if your dog has BOAS?\n\nYour vet will assess your dog‚Äôs facial shape and behaviour in certain circumstances. They will also carry out a physical examination and perform further investigation:\n\nVisual inspection\nHeavy sedation or full anaesthesia\nRhinoscopy\nX-rays and/or CT scans\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment options available for dogs with brachycephalic syndrome:\n\nThe main treatments include¬†weight control¬†and¬†surgery.\n\nWill your dog need BOAS surgery?\n\nThere is a good chance your flat-face dog has a degree of upper airway obstruction. Snoring noises are usually a sign of upper airway obstruction. The key is to decide if surgical correction will improve their quality of life.\n\nYour veterinarian might recommend one or more of the following¬†surgical procedures¬†based on your dog‚Äôs specific needs. In some cases, referral to a specialist surgeon is recommended.\n\nWidening of the nostrils\nReducing the length of the soft palate\nRemoving excessive and/or everted throat tissue\n\nEven with surgery, brachycephalic animals‚Äô airways will never be completely normal.\n\nAre there any medical treatment options for dogs with BOAS?\nWeight control\nMedication to reduce inflammation\nTreatment of any other related conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, pneumonia, and allergic diseases.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog with BOAS at home?\n\nThere is a lot you can do at home to improve your dog‚Äôs health if they have BOAS, such as:\n\nKeep your dog slim:¬†Most flat-faced dog owners resign themselves to the fact that their dog is overweight. This mostly happens because of the breed‚Äôs tendency to gain weight due to their lifestyle. Being overweight isn‚Äôt normal for flat-faced dogs. Plus carrying extra weight will make any breathing problems worse.\n\nThe best way to assess your dog is to look at their body shape. Give your dog a ‚Äúbody condition score‚Äù using the body condition score chart. Vet nurses can help you to reduce your dog‚Äôs weight.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nKeep them fit:¬†Keep your dog as fit as possible and build their fitness gradually. Flat-faced dogs often struggle to keep up with other breeds.\nUse a harness:¬†Instead of a collar to minimise pressure on the neck.\nDuring hot/humid weather:¬†Keep your dog indoors, preferably with air conditioning, and limit exercise.\nReduce any respiratory irritants in the home:¬†Such as smoke, dust, or mould.\nWhen sleeping:¬†Brachycephalic dogs may find it difficult to sleep.¬† They often snore while sleeping and wake up for brief periods when their breathing stops. You can try to raise their head up to keep their airway open when sleeping to improve their quality of sleep.\n\n¬†\n\nHow can you prevent and minimise the signs of BOAS in dogs?\n\nResponsible breeding:¬†dogs with significant breathing difficulties or that need surgery should not be used for breeding.¬†It is usually recommended that these animals be neutered at the same time surgical correction is performed.\n\nOngoing care: to reduce the severity and frequency of BOAS symptoms follow the previous recommendations on diet, exercise, and environmental modifications.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to expect if your dog has BOAS\nWhat is the overall outlook for a dog with BOAS?¬†\n\nThe prognosis for dogs with BOAS depends on how many physical problems are present and how old your dog is at the time of diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTo maintain quality of life, vet visits should be done regularly to monitor new symptoms or to see if any worsen.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat age do dogs get BOAS?\n\nBOAS usually presents in dogs between 1-4 years of age but severe cases may be noted at only a few months of age.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat age should dogs have BOAS surgery?\n\nIt is usually recommended to wait until 9 months to 1 year of age to perform surgery.\n\n¬†\n\nHow much does BOAS surgery cost for dogs?\n\nBOAS surgery can be expensive, especially if more than one aspect needs to be corrected.\n\nConsider getting your dog¬†insured¬†as soon as you get them, before any illness develops. Look carefully as not all insurance policies cover BOAS problems.\n\nTry to speak openly to your vet about any treatment cost concerns, along with what you think is right for your dog.\n\nOften, there are multiple treatment options, so if one doesn‚Äôt work for you and your pet, then your vet may be able to offer an alternative.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat other diseases are associated with flat-faced breeds?¬†\n\nNasal fold dermatitis:¬†Skin folds can become infected due to heat and moisture.¬†Keep these areas clean and dry to prevent infection.\n\nGastric and oesophageal reflux:¬†Giving specific foods and feeding in a certain way can be helpful for these dogs.¬†¬†Speak to a vet for further information.\n\nEye problems:¬†The large and protruding eyes of these dogs mean that their eyelids cannot close fully. This dries the eyes and often leads to eye ulcers and excessive tearing.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry if your dog has BOAS?\n\nSeek immediate assistance from an¬†emergency vet practice¬†if your dog:\n\nStruggles to breathe or gasps for air\nGums or tongue become blue or grey\nCollapses\n\nAt¬†Joii¬†we can help:\n\nAdvise about getting a flat-faced breed dog\nAssess your dog‚Äôs condition or help them lose weight\nBuild up their fitness gradually\nCheck if your dog has any symptoms of BOAS\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Stress and intense exercise commonly cause fast breathing, but if these are not the cause or the breathing isn‚Äôt returning to normal, a serious condition may be present.\n\nMost cats will only breathe with their mouth open if they are very stressed or have a serious problem. Normal breathing movements in cats are very subtle and silent. Any breathing changes lasting more than a few minutes should be discussed with a vet, and this is urgent if the breathing is getting worse or if it is noisy or laboured.\n\nRecording breaths per minute at rest is a useful way to monitor chronic conditions, especially those affecting the heart and lungs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my cat is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and remove anything that may cause stress for your cat.

This is usually done by placing them in a special box with high levels of oxygen flowing through it.\n\nIf there is fluid around the lungs, this will need to be drained. This procedure is called thoracocentesis.\n\nIf the airway is collapsed or there is an obstruction that cannot be immediately removed, a tube may need to be inserted directly into the windpipe, via tracheostomy.\n\nAsthma is treated with bronchodilators and steroids, either by nebulisation (a small machine used to give medication as a mist) or injection.\n\nInfections are usually treated with antibiotics.\n\nFever is usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPain is treated with analgesic medications such as opioids.\n\nTrauma to the chest or abdomen may require emergency surgery.\n\nPulmonary oedema, fluid in the lungs, is treated with diuretics.\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk for breathing problems\n\nSiamese and Oriental cats are at higher risk for asthma, mediastinal lymphoma (a type of cancer) and chylothorax (a type of fluid build-up in the chest)\n\nMaine Coons and Ragdolls are at higher risk for some types of heart disease\n\nCats that roam and fight are at higher risk for trauma and infection\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of fast breathing\n\nHeat stroke is rare in cats but possible in extreme conditions, such as in cars\n\nParacetamol is very toxic to cats and disrupts their red blood cells, causing breathing problems\n\nPulmonary thromboembolism\n\nTumours/cancer\n\nHead trauma\n\nUrinary tract rupture\n\n 2\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Cataracts are variable in size. Over time, cataracts cause loss of vision and eventually blindness.\n\nCataracts in cats are commonly associated with inflammation of the eye, called uveitis. Unlike dogs, surgery is performed less often. Your cat‚Äôs eyes should be checked by a vet if they are becoming cloudy.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are cataracts and how do they develop?\nInside the eye, there is a lens that focuses light on the back of the eye (retina).\nVision occurs at the retina.\nThe lens should be crystal clear.\nDiseases of the lens, like cataracts, can change its transparency or clarity.\nA cloudy or opaque lens is called a cataract.\nThe most common causes are uveitis and ageing.\nOther causes are genetics, trauma, and diabetes mellitus.\nThere are different degrees of severity, depending on how much of the lens is affected. Varying from too small to interfere with vision, to so large that impairs vision.\nA cataract can be classified as either incipient, immature, mature, or hypermature, according to its severity.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the signs of cataracts in cats?\n\nSymptoms of cataracts in cats include:\n\nCloudy or foggy eye\nRed eye\nBumping into things\nLess agile\nLess active\n\n¬†\n\nDo some cats have a higher risk of cataracts than others?\nCats who suffer from uveitis\nOlder cats\nCertain breeds: Russian blue and Bengal\n\n¬†\n\nHow are cataracts diagnosed?\n\nYour vet will examine your cat‚Äôs eyes and use a light source to check for cataracts and determine their stage.\n\nTo help rule out other conditions, your vet may recommend the following:\n\nTesting the pressure inside the eye\nDye test\n\nTo check for other illnesses affecting the body and the eyes\n\nBlood tests\nFeLV/FIV status\nRadiographs (x rays)\nUltrasound scans of the abdomen\nBlood pressure\n\n¬†\n\nHow can cataracts be treated?\nThe treatment will depend on the cause of the cataract.\nIn cats, cataracts are more commonly associated with uveitis, so treatment is usually a combination of oral anti-inflammatories and topical steroids.\nOther treatments may be recommended depending on the clinical signs and underlying problems of the eye.\nThe outcome of this is usually good with medical treatment.\nSurgery, like eye enucleation (removal of the eye), may be advised in severe cases such as uncontrollable glaucoma.\n\nCats with uveitis or glaucoma should be referred to an ophthalmology specialist at an early stage of the disease to maximise the chances of a successful outcome.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help a cat with cataracts at home\nA cat with cataracts or vision loss usually adapts well to the environment at home.\nIt is important to give blind cats special attention, especially around hazards such as stairs.\nIf you have a blind cat, you should avoid moving furniture or any of your cat‚Äôs belongings,¬† such as their food dish, water bowl, bed, or litter trays.\nYour cat should be handled with care when meeting a new human or animal.\n\n¬†\n\nHow can you help preserve your cat‚Äôs vision\n\nIn most cases, you cannot prevent cataracts, but there are ways to ensure that your cat‚Äôs vision is preserved, especially if a medical condition like uveitis causes it.\n\nCheck your cat‚Äôs eyes regularly.\nTake your cat to the vet if their eyes start to look cloudy.\nTake your cat to the vet if you suspect they‚Äôre having trouble seeing.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen do you need to call a vet if your cat has cataracts?\n\nWhen do you need to call a vet?\n\nSudden inability to see\nSquinting\nRedness of the eye\nReluctant to open the affected eye or pawing at the face\nNot improving despite treatment\n\nCall a Joii vet if you need help:\n\nWith your blind cat\nWith giving medication\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Cataracts are variable in size. They can appear in older dogs as well as in younger dogs. Over time, cataracts cause loss of vision and eventually blindness.\n\nCataracts are not only an old age condition. They can lead to inflammation within the eye (uveitis) and other complications like glaucoma. Reach out to a vet if you see your dog‚Äôs eye becoming cloudy.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are cataracts and how do they develop?\nInside the eye, there is a lens that focuses light on the back of the eye (retina).\nVision occurs at the retina.\nThe lens should be crystal clear.\nDiseases of the lens, like cataracts, can change its transparency or clarity.\nA cloudy or opaque lens is called a cataract.\nThere are different degrees of severity associated with how much of the lens is affected. Varying from too small to interfere with vision, to so large that impairs vision.\n¬†A cataract can be classified as either incipient, immature, mature, or hypermature, according to its severity.\nThe most common causes of cataracts are:\nGenetic\nAgeing\nDiabetes mellitus.\nOther causes are: trauma, uveitis, lens luxation, and retinal disease.\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the symptoms of cataracts in dogs?\nCloudy or foggy appearance of the pupil.\nReluctance to move, especially at night or in low-light conditions. This can be a¬† sign of decreased vision.\n\n¬†\n\nDo some dogs have a higher risk of cataracts than others?\nAdvanced age\nDiabetes mellitus\nBreeds with a high prevalence of cataracts: American cocker spaniel, Bichon Frise, Boston terrier, Miniature poodle, Standard poodle, Miniature schnauzer, and others.\nGenetic cataracts: Siberian huskies show a high prevalence of cataracts among young dogs (1-2 years of age).\n\n¬†\n\nHow are cataracts diagnosed?\n\nour vet will examine your dog‚Äôs eyes and use a light source to check for cataracts and determine their stage.\n\nTo help rule out any other conditions, your vet may recommend the following:\n\nTest the pressure inside the eye\nDye test\nTear production test\nBlood tests to check for other illnesses affecting the body and the eyes\n\n¬†\n\nHow can cataracts be treated?\n\nSurgery is the only way to improve or remove cataracts. This type of surgery is typically performed by a vet who is specialised in ophthalmology.\n\nYour dog can benefit from cataract surgery by gaining better eyesight and avoiding problems caused by long-term cataracts.\n\nThe ideal time to perform cataract surgery is usually prior to the cataract becoming mature (when the entire lens is involved).\n\nThere are currently no effective eye drop treatments that can delay or treat cataracts. You can discuss any treatment options with your ophthalmologist vet for more detailed information.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help a dog with cataracts at home\nA dog with cataracts or vision loss usually adapts well to the environment at home.\nIt is important to give blind dogs special attention, especially around hazards such as stairs, pools, and streets.\nWhen you have a blind dog, you should avoid moving furniture or any of your dog‚Äôs belongings, such as their food dish, water bowl or bed.\nWhenever your dog meets a new human or animal, they should be handled with extra care.\nUsing a halo harness can be helpful for a blind dog.\nWhat are the possible outcomes for a dog with cataracts?\n\nWithout surgical removal, cataracts may eventually cause blindness.\n\nCataracts can also cause other problems as they progress, including glaucoma and retinal detachment. Glaucoma can be painful and must be managed with eye drops.\n\nCataracts in diabetic dogs can form very quickly. Diabetic cataracts are caused by high blood sugar. Excess sugar (glucose) draws water into the lens. This causes the lens to swell, which results in cataracts. About 75-80% of diabetic dogs will develop cataracts within the first year of their diagnosis, regardless of how well-controlled their diabetes is.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow can you help preserve your dog‚Äôs vision?\n\nIn most cases, you cannot prevent cataracts, but there are ways to ensure that your dog‚Äôs vision is preserved, especially if a medical condition like diabetes causes it.\n\nThese include:\n\nChecking your dog‚Äôs eyes regularly.\nTaking your dog to the vet if their eyes start to look cloudy.\nTaking your dog to the vet if you suspect they‚Äôre having trouble seeing.\nWhen possible, finding out the medical history of your dog‚Äôs parents, since cataracts are often inherited.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen do you need to call a vet if your dog has cataracts?\n\nIf your dog shows any of the following signs call your vet:\n\nSudden inability to see\nSquinting\nRedness of the eye\nReluctant to open the affected eye or pawing at the face\n\nCall us at Joii if:\n\nYou have a blind dog and need help adjusting to their environment\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Most cases are not serious and clear with prompt treatment. Any breed or age of cat can develop conjunctivitis; however, it is more common in young cats and kittens.\n\nConjunctivitis or ‚Äúpink eye‚Äù is one of the most common causes of red, inflamed eyes in cats. It occurs when the conjunctiva is irritated or infected. Cats can spread some infectious forms to each other. It‚Äôs recommended that you speak to a vet to see if your cat needs medical treatment.\n\nWhat is conjunctivitis in cats and what are the causes?\n\nThis condition refers to redness and inflammation of the conjunctiva.\n\nThe conjunctiva is the tissue that covers the inner surface of the eyelids and the white part of the eye (sclera).\n\nBoth eyes are usually affected, but it can also affect just one.\n\nConjunctivitis is mostly caused by viruses and bacteria.\n\nEye anatomy.\n\nThe most common viruses and bacteria responsible for conjunctivitis are often seen with cat flu disease (such as Herpes virus, Calicivirus, and Chlamydia).\n\nOther causes include:\n\nEye ulcers\nTrauma\nForeign object (such as grass seeds)\nParasites\nImmune-mediated diseases\nSystemic diseases (cats with these diseases usually have other signs of illness) examples: feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), or feline panleukopenia\nAllergies and environmental irritation (dust, smoke, chemicals, air fresheners)\nGlaucoma (a disease that increases the pressure inside of the eye)\nUveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye)\nTear duct diseases\nEyelid and eyelash problems\nEye tumours\n\nIf left untreated the condition can be harder to treat and lead to severe eye issues.\n\n \n\nHow to tell if your cat has conjunctivitis?\n\nYou might see some or all of the following symptoms in your cat:\n\nEye discharge (yellow, green, or clear)\nPink or red eye\nPawing or rubbing at the face\nBlinking more than usual or squinting\nSwelling of the tissue that lines the eyelids and surface of the eye (conjunctiva)\nInner corner of the eye membrane (third eyelid) more pronounced\n\nAre some cats more likely to get conjunctivitis?\n\nHigh population density (such as animal shelters and multi-cat households):\n\nCats that live with multiple other cats are more prone to conjunctivitis due to infectious causes (virus, bacteria).\nGood hand hygiene between handling and medicating infected cats is essential.\nSeparating these cats during the illness period will help prevent the spread of the disease to the other cats.\n\nKittens\n\nAre usually more severely affected than adults because they find it harder to fight infections.\nHowever, the outcome is still very positive, unless the kitten presents with more severe symptoms of cat flu.\n\nCats with a weakened immune system\n\nThese cats may have more difficulties getting rid of the symptoms or may also experience more flare-ups.\nThis includes cats with immune-mediated diseases or systemic infectious diseases (i.e. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), or feline panleukopenia).\n\nStressful environment or episodes of stress: can be a cause of the relapse of infectious conjunctivitis.\n\nFlat-faced cat breeds: Brachycephalic cat breeds such as Persian, Himalayan, and Exotic short-hair are at a higher risk of conjunctivitis due to an increased risk of eyelid and tear duct abnormalities.

In most cases, it can be easily resolved. Treatments include:\n\nGeneral treatment for mild conjunctivitis:\n\nEye cleaners: drops, wipes\nLubricating, soothing treatment: gels, ointments, drops\n\nPrescription medicines depend on the underlying cause:\n\nAnti-viral: oral medication\nAntibiotics: gels, ointments, drops for the eyes or oral medication\nSteroid anti-inflammatory: drops or ointment for the eyes or oral tablets\n\nOther treatments or surgery may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of conjunctivitis. Glaucoma and eyelid problems are two examples.\n\nThings you can do at home to help ease the symptoms of conjunctivitis in your cat\n\nUse sterile saline to flush the eye:\n\nUse a cotton ball soaked in saline solution to flush a few drops into the eye 2-4 times daily.\nClean any accumulated discharge around the eye using a cotton pad.\nSterile saline is available in pharmacies.

This can be more urgent if they are off their food or vomiting.\n\nIf the amount of poo your cat is producing is noticeably less than usual, a vet check is recommended.¬†\n\nPainful or difficult pooing should also be checked, even if the amount seems normal.\n\nHow to tell if your cat is constipated\nSpending a lot of time in the pooing position\nVisibly straining or having abdominal contractions\nCrying or calling, especially in their tray or favourite toileting spot\nPassing only very small amounts of poo or none at all¬†\nStools (poo) are dry and hard, possibly with a small amount of mucus¬†\nVomiting, eating less or becoming quiet and subdued.\n\nCats may not pass stools for a day or two after a bad bout of diarrhoea. This can be normal as long as there is no straining or discomfort.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy is my cat constipated?\nCommon¬† causes of constipation in cats\n\nIn many cats, the gut movement slows down with age. This can lead to build-up of faeces. The end of the intestine becomes dilated, which worsens the problem. This can progress to Megacolon.\n\nInjuries to the bones of the pelvis can reduce the space available for poo to pass through, leading to serious constipation. This may only become noticeable some time after a serious accident or injury.\n\nLack of exercise, obesity or unbalanced diets.\n\nEating too much of things that are hard to digest, like hair or bones. For example, due to overgrooming or hunting.\n\nArthritis or other painful conditions that make straining or positioning to poo difficult.¬†\n\nStress. Some cats can become constipated if they‚Äôve been too stressed to use the litter tray for several days, or if something is putting them off using it.\n\nRare conditions affecting nerve and muscle function.¬†\n\nRare causes of constipation in cats\n\nDysautonomia or other forms of neuromuscular (nerve and muscle) disease¬†\n\nBirth defects\n\nSpinal cord disease\n\nRectal diverticula (deformity on the rectal wall)\n\nOther illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, hypokalemia or hypocalcemia\n\nWhen to worry about constipation\n\nContact a vet straight away if your cat is repeatedly straining without producing anything, especially if they are also vomiting or not eating.\n\nHow to prevent constipation in cats\n\nConstipation due to medical problems usually requires specific medications to prevent repeated episodes.¬†¬†\n\nThe most important thing to prevent constipation is to have a healthy and balanced diet, with the right proportions of the different types of fibre.¬†\n\nGood water intake can help prevent constipation. This can be encouraged by changing the water in the bowl frequently or providing a cat fountain.\n\nDiagnosing constipation in cats\n\nSevere constipation can sometimes be diagnosed on abdominal palpation or rectal examination. This may not be possible in bigger cats or if they are very uncomfortable. A detailed evaluation of the severity of the problem requires x-rays of the abdomen.\n\n¬†How can I help my cat with constipation?¬†\n\nThe right treatment for constipation depends on the cause, so getting a diagnosis is always important.\n\nPreventing dehydration and increasing the water content of the stool is often helpful. Encourage your cat to drink water and, if there is no vomiting, feed wet food or add water to the food.\n\nIf constipation is due to excessive ingestion of hair, a hairball paste may be able to help. This is best discussed with a vet.\n\nWhat is the treatment for constipation in cats?\n\nDepending on the cause of the constipation, there are several medications or procedures your vet may recommend.\n\nIf your cat is dehydrated, it is very important to correct this as quickly as possible.\n\nMild cases can be treated with laxatives. These come in different types:\n\nEmollient laxatives prevent water from being removed from the stool and make it softer.¬†\nLubricant laxatives coat the stool and make it slippery and easier to pass. These are used rectally (given directly into your cat‚Äôs bottom) and are not safe to give by mouth.\nOsmotic laxatives draw water into the stool to make it softer. These are not safe if your cat is dehydrated.\nStimulant laxatives increase gut movements to push the stool onward. This can be done by increasing bulk (fibre products) or stimulating the intestinal wall directly. These laxatives are not safe if there is a physical blockage which is making stool passage impossible.\nSome laxatives will work in more than one way. Lactulose, for example, is both osmotic and stimulant.\n\nThere are medications that directly increase the strength and frequency of intestinal movements, called prokinetics. These are especially useful in cases where the gut is not moving properly, like Megacolon. They can be dangerous if an obstruction is present.\n\nSerious cases of constipation require enemas performed under sedation. This is a procedure where fluid and lubricants are administered directly into the rectum and the faeces are gently removed.\n\nSevere cases may require surgery to empty the colon.\n\nAre some cats more at risk of constipation than others?\n\nOlder cats are at higher risk of constipation, especially if they‚Äôve had it before.¬†\n\nCats that have previously suffered pelvic injuries may also be at higher risk\n\nManx cats are at risk for several conditions that can cause constipation\n\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Respiratory problems can progress quickly and be life-threatening. Always speak to a vet if unsure.\n\nSome of the more common causes are respiratory infections, asthma and hairballs. Older cats are more likely to have chronic diseases or tumours.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is coughing\n\nSpeak to a vet straight away if a cough is associated with wheezing, lethargy, difficulty breathing, exercise intolerance or complete lack of appetite. Emergency treatment may be needed.\n\nCall your vet for an appointment if your cat has been coughing for more than two weeks, even if the cough is mild and they are otherwise well.\n\nCats can try to hide their symptoms. If you are worried, speaking to a telemedicine vet may help decide the best thing to do.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat causes coughing in cats?\n\nInfections are common, especially in young cats. These can be viral, like Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, or caused by bacteria like Mycoplasma Felis. These are usually caught from other cats but can stay in the body for some time without causing symptoms.\n\nParasites, such as Lungworm, can also cause coughing. These are usually caught while hunting.\n\nAllergy/Asthma- Allergic bronchial disease or asthma is relatively common in cats and sometimes causes coughing.\n\nForeign bodies, such as blades of grass or seeds, can find their way into a cat‚Äôs windpipe and cause sudden and intense bouts of coughing and retching.\n\nPolyps: Cats can develop small lumps or polyps at the back of their nasal passages. This can lead to coughing.\n\nHeart disease can cause coughing because of fluid build-up in the lungs, this usually happens when the disease is very advanced.\n\nTumours or cancer that have grown or spread to the chest may eventually cause coughing.\n\nRare causes:\n\nCats that are very weak and vomit can sometimes inhale the sick, causing aspiration pneumonia. This can also happen in cats that have diseases that interfere with how they swallow their food.\nElectrocution can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and cause coughing and respiratory problems.\nSevere head trauma can sometimes cause fluid buildup in the lungs as well.\nA Pulmonary Thromboembolism (a blood clot stopping blood flow to a part of the lungs)¬† is another rare cause of coughing.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about coughing in cats\n\nCats are very good at pacing themselves and hiding symptoms if they‚Äôre feeling unwell. It‚Äôs very important to be vigilant when they are unwell, especially with things that affect their breathing. Contact a vet straight away if your cat has any of the following:\n\nTrouble breathing¬†\nWheezing\nOpen-mouth breathing\nPale or bluish gums\nHiding all the time\nNot eating anything\nTired or breathing fast after minimal exercise or movement\n\nEven if no other symptoms are present, a vet check is recommended if the cough is frequent, severe or has been present for more than a week.\n\nPreventing coughing in cats\n\nRegular vaccination against Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus and Feline Leukemia Virus will protect against infection.\n\nRegular deworming treatment will prevent the development of parasitic lung disease. This may need to be done frequently for very active hunters.\n\nPreventative use of a good quality hairball paste can be beneficial, especially for long-haired cats or when they are shedding a lot.\n\nRegular health checks may allow early detection of chronic conditions that can eventually lead to coughing.\n\nDiagnosis of coughing in cats\n\nA basic visual examination can be very useful if concerned about a cough. Evaluating the rate and type of breathing, colour of the gums, general behaviour and body language can assist in determining how serious the problem might be.\n\nListening to your cat‚Äôs chest with a stethoscope tells the vet a lot about the status of the lungs and bronchi.¬†\n\nIf your cat is very unwell, your vet may advise that they stay in a high-oxygen environment for a period of time. This is often life-saving and can also prevent complications during other procedures.\n\nX-rays or ultrasound are frequently recommended. This is to confirm or evaluate the extent of any lung issues suspected on auscultation. It may also detect foreign bodies.\n\nBlood or faecal tests allow diagnosis of some infections. Others require a sample to be obtained from the airways with a swab.\n\nHow to help a cat that is coughing\n\nDo not hesitate to contact a vet if the cough is severe or your cat is unwell in other ways.\n\nYour cat may find it easier to eat and swallow if fed soft, wet food. However, if they prefer to eat dry please make sure this is also available.\n\nTry to avoid exposure to scented candles, diffusers, air fresheners or smoke.\n\nBreathing moist steamy air may help with congestion in their airways. This can be achieved by having them in the bathroom when the shower is being used.\n\nHow a vet can help your coughing cat\n\nGiving oxygen is life-saving if a cat is struggling to breathe.\n\nIf fluid is detected within the lungs, your cat may need to continue receiving oxygen treatment while being given medication to address this.\n\nIf fluid is detected around the lungs, this will need to be drained and a chest drain may need to be placed.\n\nIf a foreign body is suspected, a bronchoscopy or rhinoscopy may be recommended. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed down the throat or up the back of the mouth. This allows the inside of the airways to be examined.\n\nWith certain types of infections, or if cancer is suspected but not seen on x-rays, a broncho-alveolar lavage may be recommended. This is similar to a bronchoscopy, but after visual examination, a small amount of fluid is introduced into the airway and then collected. This allows loose cells in the airway to be collected for analysis.\n\nAre some cats more at risk?\n\nYounger cats are more likely to have an infection or developmental problem\n\nOlder cats are more likely to have heart disease or tumours\n\nCertain breeds such as¬† Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Persian, Sphynx and both American and British Shorthairs are at higher risk for heart disease.\n\nSiamese and Oriental cats have a higher risk of asthma.\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

It usually results in back leg lameness. Not all cases require surgery for treatment.\n\nThe most common form of knee ligament injury is the tearing of the cranial cruciate ligament ¬†(CrCL). In cats, it usually occurs as a result of trauma. This disease can also be called CrCL rupture, CrCL tear, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disease, or torn knee ligaments.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is cruciate ligament disease in cats?¬†\n\nYour cat‚Äôs knee is a complex structure consisting of multiple bones: thigh bone (femur), kneecap (patella), shinbone (tibia), ligaments, and meniscus.\n\nThe cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) is one of four ligaments that hold the knee joint together.\n\nIf the cruciate ligament is damaged, the knee becomes unstable and often very painful.\n\nCrCL can tear partially or completely.\n\nCats are more likely to have other ligaments rupture alongside with CrCL.\n\nDamage to the meniscus can occur in around 50% of cats that have CrCL rupture.\n\nLimping is often the first sign to be identified.\n\nTrauma is the most common cause, but inherited weak ligaments or obesity can cause cats to damage their cruciate ligaments too.\n\nAs a result of this condition, limb function will deteriorate if not treated, and arthritis will progress.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the signs of cruciate ligament disease in cats?¬†\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your cat:\n\nLimping, that can start suddenly, worsen, persist, or become occasional\nA painful leg\nReluctance to exercise or difficulty jumping and using the stairs\nStiffness\nChange in behaviour: quieter than usual, hiding\n\nPeople express pain and discomfort differently from pets, so although cats may not meow, cry out, or hold up their sore limb constantly, the persistence of their lameness is a sign of pain.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of cruciate ligament disease?\n\nCruciate ligament disease is mostly seen in:\n\nOutdoor cats or highly exercised cats who suddenly jump or turn as they run. The ligaments are damaged by a twisting injury to the knee.\nOld age can weaken the ligaments.\nObese cats can damage their ligaments due to the excess strain on the joints.

It usually requires surgery for treatment. Dogs of large and giant breeds are more prone to this condition, but it can affect dogs of any breed or age.¬†\n\nThe most common form of knee ligament injury is the tearing of the cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL). It may occur as a result of trauma or due to an inherited weakness. Within one year of undergoing surgery, 20-50% of cases develop a ligament tear in the opposite knee, so treatment should begin as soon as possible to prevent further injury. This disease can also be called CrCL rupture, CrCL tear, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disease, or torn knee ligaments.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is cruciate ligament disease in dogs?\n\nYour dog‚Äôs knee is a complex structure consisting of multiple bones: thigh bone (femur), kneecap (patella), shinbone (tibia), ligaments, and meniscus.\n\nThe cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) is one of four ligaments that hold the knee joint together.\n\nIf one of the cruciate ligaments is damaged, the knee becomes unstable and often very painful.\n\nThe CrCL can tear partially or completely.\n\nDamage to the meniscus can occur in a large percentage of dogs with CrCL rupture.\n\nLimping is often the first sign seen.\n\nCauses of cruciate ligament injury include exercise, inherited weak ligaments, and obesity. Yet, any breed, size, or age of dog can injure their cruciate ligament.\n\nAs a result of this condition, limb function will deteriorate if not treated, and arthritis will progress.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the signs of cruciate ligament disease in dogs?\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your dog:¬†\n\nLimping that can start suddenly, worsen, persist, or become occasional\nPainful leg¬†\nReluctance to exercise or difficulty getting up, jumping, or using stairs¬†\nSwelling of the knee joint¬†\nSitting with the affected limb extended out to the side¬†\nLoss of muscle mass in the affected leg\n\nPeople express pain and discomfort differently from dogs, so although dogs may not whine, cry out, or hold up their affected limb constantly, the persistence of their lameness is a sign of pain. ¬†\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of cruciate ligament disease?¬†\n\nCruciate ligament disease is mostly seen in:\n\nAthletic dogs who suddenly jump or turn as they run. The ligaments are damaged by a twisting injury to the knee.\nBreeds that have weak ligaments, such as Newfoundland, Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Staffordshire Terrier, Mastiff, Akita, and Saint Bernard.\nLarger dogs weighing more than 22 kg are at greater risk of cruciate disease and tend to develop CrCL rupture at younger ages.\nOlder age (7 to 10 years) can weaken the ligaments, which may tear more easily, particularly in dogs weighing more than 15 kg.\nObese dogs can damage their ligaments due to the excess strain on the joints.\n\n¬†\n\nHow vets diagnose cruciate ligament disease in dogs¬†\nComplete tears of the CrCL¬†\n\nIs diagnosed by your vet using a combination of:\n\nWatching the way your dog walks\nHands-on examination (including a special knee movement test, which is usually done under sedation)\nRadiographs (X-rays)\nOccasionally MRI\nPartial CrCL tears¬†\n\nCan be more challenging to diagnose, requiring a visual inspection of the joint with:\n\nExploratory surgery (open knee surgery)\nArthroscopy (keyhole surgery with a camera on the joint)\n\nThis type of investigation may need to be conducted by a specialist vet in a referral hospital.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for dogs with cruciate ligament disease¬†\n\nTreatment consists of surgical and medical management. Even when surgery is recommended, medical management after surgery is essential.\n\nSurgery¬†\n\nSurgery is usually the recommended treatment option to restore function to the affected knee.\n\nThese repairs involve the structures around the ligaments, not the ligaments themselves. This is because bone healing is more efficient than ligament healing.\n\nThe surgery may need to be performed by a specialist vet at a referral hospital.\n\nDepending on your dog‚Äôs medical needs, the vet may recommend the following surgical techniques:\n\nExtracapsular suture stabilisation\nTibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO)\nTibial tuberosity advancement (TTA)\nMedical management¬†\n\nNon-surgical treatment may only be possible in small dogs, in cases of partial CrCL tears, or in cases where surgery is not an option due to financial limitations or anaesthetic risk.\n\nFor best results, all of the following will be needed:\n\nActivity restriction for several weeks\nAnti-inflammatory and pain medication\nWeight control or weight loss\nJoint supplements to slow the progression of arthritis\nRehabilitation and physiotherapy\nA custom-made knee brace may also be recommended to stabilise the damaged knee, reduce pain, and allow some return of function. However, there isn‚Äôt much research in veterinary medicine to support this option.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog at home if they have cruciate ligament disease¬†\n\nFollow your vet‚Äôs recommendation and exercise restriction plan.\n\nYour vet‚Äôs plan will be very detailed for the first 6-8 weeks.\nKeep your dog rested by using a cage or leaving them in small rooms of the house with no access to high furniture (sofa or bed).\nKeep their minds busy by feeding them in slow feeders and play mats.\nStart physiotherapy as soon as possible and continue for the following 3-6 months. The protocol sessions will change as the bone heals and the main goal changes.\nA healthy weight is necessary both for the injured knee, as well as, to prevent the other knee from getting injured.\nStart them on a good joint supplement to slow the progression of arthritis.\nLots of cuddles, love, and patience.\nLiving with a dog with cruciate ligament disease¬†\nIs post-operative care difficult?¬†\n\nThere are a few points that can cause frustration due to the length of the treatment time. These are the exercise restrictions and physiotherapy.\n\nActivity is highly restricted for 6-8 weeks after surgery.\n\nThe activity restriction may be less if a TPLO or TTA has been performed.\n\nWithin 3 months, good function should return to the limb if you follow your vet‚Äôs instructions and keep up with the physiotherapy.\n\nMany joint supplements are available; which one should you choose?¬†\n\nThe key ingredient a joint supplement should contain is:\n\nGreen lipped mussel extract (a bivalve mollusc extract)\nOmega-3&6 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids)\n\nOther ingredients that may also have an effect are:\n\nDPLA (a protein that is believed to have pain relief and mood elevating effects)\nSAMe (a compound found naturally in the body)\nCBD (an active ingredient in cannabis extracted from hemp plant)\nHyaluronic acid (a component of joint fluid that gives it elasticity)\nChondroitin sulphate (extracted from mammalian cartilage, normally cow windpipes)\nCollagen hydrosylates (also known as gelatin; it‚Äôs made from collagenous structures of mammals such as bovine tendons)\nGlucosamine (a natural compound found in cartilage)\nVitamin E\nAre physiotherapy and rehabilitation important?\n\nIn order to improve limb function and quality of life, this condition typically requires expensive surgery and physiotherapy.\n\nFor a successful recovery and the prevention of injury to the other knee, physiotherapy is essential.\n\nPhysiotherapy can begin the day after surgery, continue for 6‚Äì8 weeks, and be maintained for at least 3 months.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals:\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬† The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nHydrotherapy: National Association of Registered Canine Hydrotherapists, Canine Hydrotherapy Association\nThe progression of arthritis is inevitable¬†\n\nTo slow the progression of the disease, we recommend starting your dog on a good joint supplement as well as modifying their exercise regime over time.\n\nSee our arthritis article for more information.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to prevent your dog from getting cruciate ligament disease?\n\nWeight control is the key\n\nIf your dog is overweight, the post-surgical recovery time will be much longer.\nObesity also greatly increases the risk of injury to the other knee, especially during the recovery period.\nWeight loss is as important as surgery in ensuring a rapid return to normal function.\nVets and nurses can help develop an appropriate weight-loss plan for your pet.\nCheck your dog‚Äôs body score condition (BSC) to see if they are overweight.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n\n\n¬†\n\nWhen you should be worried about your dog with cruciate ligament disease?¬†\n\nIf your dog was diagnosed with CrCL disease, contact your local vet practice if they are:\n\nNot improving despite treatment\nPainful or stiff or there is swelling in any joint\nStruggling to run, jump, or use the stairs\nVomiting, diarrhoea, or loss of appetite, if medication has been prescribed\n\nJoii can help:\n\nIf your dog had treatment for CrCL disease and you need tips to keep them calm and rested at home\nIf your dog is vomiting, has diarrhoea, or a loss of appetite, if medication has been prescribed\nIf you need help and advice on slowing the progression of arthritis\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

It is very rare in cats. It affects many organs and body functions and, in some cases, can be due to cancer.\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome, or hyperadrenocorticism, happens when the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol.¬† This disrupts normal metabolism and causes many problems, such as an increased risk of infections and diabetes. Treatments are available, but most cats have other conditions at the same time, and they often do not do well.\n\nA similar disease can happen in cats that have been on treatment with very high doses of steroids for a long time, but this can be solved by slowly reducing the treatment dose. This must always be done under close monitoring by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Cushing‚Äôs syndrome in cats?\n\nCushing‚Äôs syndrome is a disease caused by a growth or cyst in one of two organs, the pituitary gland near the brain or the adrenal glands near the kidneys. This growth can sometimes be cancerous.\n\n90% of cats will also have diabetes, and many have kidney or heart disease.\n\nAffects middle-aged and older cats. This is a serious and life-long condition.\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs syndrome\n\nSymptoms of Cushing‚Äôs disease are varied due to the effects of the hormone on many organs.\n\nExcessive drinking and urination are very common, this may lead to toileting accidents in the house.\n\nIncreased appetite is very common.\n\nHair loss and repeated skin infections are frequent, the skin can be easily injured or even torn.\n\nMuscles can become weaker and exercising difficult.\n\nRespiratory infections happen easily and can be difficult to treat.\n\nIncreased sexual behaviour may be noted.\n\nChanges in general behaviour or seizures can happen if the brain becomes affected.\n\nAre some cats at higher risk than others?\n\nThere are no known breed or sex risk factors.\n\nThis disease happens in middle-aged and older cats.\n\nHow is Cushing‚Äôs syndrome diagnosed in cats?\n\nHormones are affected by many diseases and normal body functions, so a combination of symptoms and tests is required.\n\nA basic urine test can detect secondary bacterial infections and kidney problems.

Patience and supportive care will help your dog with dementia to enjoy the quality of life for as long as possible.\n\nWhat is dementia in dogs?\n\nDementia is also called Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCD or CDS).\n\nIt‚Äôs a progressive disease affecting the brain.\nDementia is more than simply ‚Äòold age‚Äô.\nThe cause isn‚Äôt fully understood.\nDogs with dementia have abnormal proteins in their brains¬†called beta amyloid and Tau.\nOther factors are likely to influence how quickly the disease develops and progresses.\n\n¬†\n\nDementia:¬†causes and development of symptoms\nAbnormal proteins build up on nerves in the brain\nParts of the brain that control memory, learning and anxiety begin to decay\nThe behaviour and habits controlled by damaged nerves fail as the disease progresses\nDogs diagnosed with dementia will get worse over time. Most will die within 2 years\nThere‚Äôs no cure for dementia, but our understanding of the disease is improving all the time.\nMedication can improve symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.\nKeeping your dog physically fit and mentally active reduces the risk and progression of dementia\nComparison between a normal looking brain and a brain with Alzheimer‚Äôs. A similar process occurs in dementia in dogs.\n\nSymptoms of dementia in dogs\nConfusion.\nForgetting toilet training ‚Äì accidents in the house.\nDisorientation- getting lost in the house, staring into space.\nBecoming less playful and more irritable.\nNot recognising ‚Äòfamiliar‚Äô people and places.\nSleep/wake cycle disturbances ‚Äì¬† awake all night, sleeping all day.\nPacing, barking, howling or whining.\nBeing more clingy and suffering from separation anxiety.\n\nDementia itself does not usually cause pain. But many dogs with dementia also suffer painful conditions such as arthritis in later life, and dementia can aggravate these. Compulsive pacing will hurt arthritic joints.\n\nCheck dementia symptoms\n\nDogs at higher risk of dementia\n\nThe biggest risk factor for dementia is advancing age.\n\nGetting older: risk increases by 50% with each year of age.\nHaving poor hearing or sight means fewer messages reach the brain to keep it occupied.\nBeing neutered.\nTerrier and toy breeds: non-sporting dogs are 3 times as likely as other breeds.\nBeing inactive ‚Äì dogs who don‚Äôt exercise are over 6 times more likely to be affected by dementia.\nHaving other long-term illnesses: arthritis, liver disease, kidney disease, and an underactive thyroid gland.\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching Dementia?\n\nDementia affects individual dogs or people. You and your other pets are not at any risk of catching dementia from your dog.\n\nDiagnosis of dementia in dogs\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a single test for dementia.\n\nVets diagnose dementia in dogs based on the following:\n\nChanges in behaviour\nChanges in habits\nPhysical examination\nRuling out other illnesses\n\nHow do vets treat dementia in dogs?\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a cure for dementia.\n\nThe treatment goal is to improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.\n\nTreatment options include:\n\nMedicines¬†for dementia from a vet\nSelegiline¬†improves the symptoms of dementia, especially housetraining, sleeping patterns and activity levels\nPropentofylline may help your older dog‚Äôs energy levels by improving blood supply to their muscles, heart and brain.\nAntidepressant medicines: treat the anxiety symptoms associated with dementia. These medicines are used ‚Äúoff licence‚Äù. This means they are human medicines vets use for dogs under special circumstances.\n\n¬†\n\nSpecial prescriptions foods\nAntioxidants to protect nerves and other tissues from damage.\nSpecial types of fat (medium chain triglycerides) to give the brain extra energy.\n\n¬†\n\nSpecial supplements¬†which contain natural chemicals to help with:\nSupporting liver and brain function\nHelping nerve cells to communicate with one another and improving your dog‚Äôs memory, learning and willingness to interact\n\n¬†\n\nGeneral supplements\nVitamins\nEssential fatty acids\n\nHome remedies to support dogs with dementia\n\nComplementary therapies\n\nAnything which helps to relieve anxiety or stress:\n\ndiffusers that promote a calming effect\ncompression shirts\nmassage\nherbal remedies\n\nBe patient\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to live with house-soiling, constant pacing, whining, sleep disturbances and separation anxiety. But negative responses, like frustration or annoyance, will only add to your dog‚Äôs stress and anxiety and make things worse.\nOlder dogs may not have much energy on walks but they‚Äôll want to spend more time checking out all the interesting smells\n\nKeep to regular routines: Your dog will cope best with familiar walks, meal times and surroundings. Minimise changes and plan in advance if these can‚Äôt be avoided.\n\nGive your dog more toileting opportunities: If your dog is soiling in the house, take them for shorter walks more often or provide special areas for them to toilet in the garden or indoors\n\nIncrease daytime activity: Keeping your dog more active during the day may help them to rest at night. Reducing stimulation in the evening may help to reduce nighttime pacing and disturbance\n\nPlay and stimulation: Your older dog may not be able to play in the same way as a puppy, but keep them interested and active with familiar toys and games\n\nProvide protected rest areas: Older dogs with dementia won‚Äôt want to be bothered by young children or puppies some (or any!) of the time. Giving your older dog a quiet area to sleep undisturbed will make life safer and more comfortable for everyone\n\nAdapt visual cues: You may need to change the commands and signals you use to communicate with your dog if they have forgotten the usual ones or no longer understand them.\n\nMake allowance for other illnesses: Make it easier for an older dog with arthritis to get up and move around. They‚Äôll struggle with slippy laminate or vinyl. Provide a shallow step to make it easier to get outside and a soft harness for support on walks.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a dog with dementia\n\nMake practical allowances¬†for your dog being slower, confused, forgetful and clumsy\n\nplug in night lights\nprovide additional water bowls around the house\nuse corner protectors on sharp edges to prevent injury\navoid redecorating or moving furniture around\n\nAvoid change¬†or prepare well in advance if unavoidable (travelling for example)\n\nUse stress relief measures (Thundershirts, pheromone collars and sprays, prescription medicine from a vet)\nPlan for additional toilet breaks\nTake along a familiar bed or blanket\n\nGive them space when they don‚Äôt want to interact. Your dog may not want to play or even want cuddles. Let them choose and be there for them when they are ready for attention again.\n\n¬†\n\nQuality of life in dogs with dementia\n\nDementia is a progressive illness. It can‚Äôt be cured.¬†Dementia will worsen over time and eventually will end in death. Death may be due to dementia itself or to another illness. And one illness may worsen the other.\n\nIt‚Äôs very hard to see a loved one decline and seem to be in distress. You start to wonder if they have any quality of life. If your dog¬† doesn‚Äôt have quality of life any more, it may be kindest to bring their life to a peaceful end with an overdose of anaesthetic (euthanasia).\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to say goodbye\n\nYou may worry how you‚Äôll know when it is time to say goodbye as your dog‚Äôs illness advances\n\nIt‚Äôs a decision that‚Äôs very hard to make and distressing for everyone involved. The best any of us can do is focus on what‚Äôs best for our beloved companion. We can start by thinking about their quality of life.

The good news is that owners can do a lot to reduce the risk of early-onset dementia and to slow its progression.\n\nKeep your dog as active and fit as possible with regular walks.\n\nKeep your dog mentally active with games, toys, and playing with people and other dogs.\n\nKeep on top of your dog‚Äôs preventive care, including vaccination and regular worm and flea treatments.\n\nFeed your dog the best diet¬†for their age, health and lifestyle.¬†A healthy balanced diet contains all the nutrients, vitamins and essential minerals to keep your dog‚Äôs body in top condition, including their brain.\n\nTreat other illnesses.\n\nTake your dog for regular check-ups with a vet\nGive prescribed medicines as directed by a vet\n\nWhen to worry about your dog with dementia\n\n¬†\n\nSigns that dementia is worsening\nStopping eating\nNo longer interacting with you\nNot going out for walks or toileting\nBecoming irritable or even aggressive\nBeing unable to settle or rest\nSuffering episodes of collapse or have seizures\n\nYour dog may also deteriorate rapidly, either due to advanced dementia itself or when dementia happens with another illness.\n\n¬†\n\nFind your nearest vet if\nYour dog has collapsed\nYour dog is unresponsive\nYour dog has become dangerous to others or himself\n\nJoii can help with¬†advice on\n\nMedicines can help dogs with dementia\nGames and exercise to keep your dog‚Äôs body and brain active\nHow to support a dog with poor memory and confusion\nHow to care for an anxious dog\nIf you‚Äôre worried your dog is distressed\nTo talk through options for end-of-life care\nTo talk about euthanasia and what it means\nTo find out what happens afterwards\nWith Bereavement Support\n\n¬†\n\n 2 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

There are many different causes, but the most common are infections and allergies.¬†¬†\n\n¬†\n\nEar disease can affect cats of all ages, but some breeds may be at greater risk. While many cases are quick and easy to clear up, some causes of ear disease can lead to severe pain, and lifelong treatment may be needed. Ear disease is often referred to as otitis, which means inflammation of the ear.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is ear disease in cats?\n\nEar disease is a common problem that vets see and treat on a daily basis.\n\nThere are many different causes, with bacterial infections and allergies being the most common.\nEar disease can happen at any age\nInfections are usually caused by reduction of air flow and the build-up of moisture\nEar disease may be easy to treat if caught early. Simple infections should clear within 1-2 weeks with appropriate treatment.\nIf not treated early, the ear can become damaged and thickened, and treatment becomes difficult\nSome cats may need lifelong treatment if they have underlying problems like allergies.\nIt‚Äôs important to investigate for underlying causes; otherwise, the ear problems will continue to return\nMay affect different parts of the ear: the ear flap and canal (Otitis externa), middle ear (Otitis media) or inner ear (Otitis interna)\nMost cases of middle or inner ear disease are due to bacteria after a ruptured eardrum. Ruptured ear drums are caused by repeated ear infections or incorrect cleaning.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of ear disease in cats include:\n\nAllergies:¬†Food allergies¬†and environmental\nBacterial and fungal infections\nEar mites and¬†Mange\nForeign bodies (such as grass seeds)\nInjuries, such as cat bite¬†Wounds¬†\nEar growths, such as tumours or polyps\nSolar dermatitis: inflammation of the tip of the ear due to sunlight exposure. More common in cats with white ears.\nVestibular disease in cats\nIncorrect ear cleaning\nEndocrine disorders, such as diabetes\n\nThese conditions can lead to secondary bacterial and yeast infections in the ears. Severe head shaking can lead to an aural haematoma.\n\nEar disease can be very painful in cats, and if not treated quickly, it may lead to lifelong problems and deafness. If your cat shows any signs of ear disease, speak to a vet as soon as possible to discuss the next steps.\n\nOur Joii vets are available 24 hours a day if you have any concerns.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of ear disease in cats\n\nOne or both ears may be affected\n\nEar irritation: scratching at the ears or rubbing them on the floor\nHead shaking\nPain: avoidance or aggression when touched near the head or ears\nRed, inflamed skin inside the ears\nDischarge, such as wax, pus, or blood inside the ears\nHair loss or skin sores around the ears\nA bad smell from the ears\nA head tilt\nLoss of balance\nA swollen ear tip is called an aural haematoma\nReduced appetite, or lethargy\nCat with ear discharge\nCat with aural haematoma\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of ear disease than others?\n\nAny cat, regardless of age or breed, can develop ear disease. However, there are some known risk factors including\n\n¬†\n\nBreeds: Scottish Fold, Himalayan, and Persian cats. These breeds are at higher risk due to the abnormal shape of the ear.\nRegular exposure to moisture, such as too frequent or incorrect cleaning\nKittens and outdoor cats are more at risk of ear mites\nTumours and masses are more common in older cats\nImmunocompromised cats, such as those with FIV or FeLV are at a higher risk of developing ear infections\nIs my family at risk of catching ear disease from cats?\n\nNone of the common causes of ear disease are known to transfer from cats to humans.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is ear disease diagnosed in cats?\n\nThe diagnosis of ear disease will usually begin with a full physical exam, including an otoscopic exam. Your vet will look down the ear canal with a scope to check the eardrum and check for any abnormalities, such as foreign bodies or growths.\n\nDepending on the findings, further tests may include\n\nA swab of the ear, for cytology, to find out if bacteria, yeast, mites or other cells are present\nA swab may be sent off to see what medication is best to treat the infection\nEar flushing, to clean the ear thoroughly\nA biopsy of the skin or any growths in the ear\nImaging: Skull x-rays, CT or MRI may be recommended for certain conditions, especially those affecting the middle and inner ear\nOther tests to check for underlying diseases include diet trials, allergy skin testing, and blood and urine tests.\n\nThe above tests often require sedation or anaesthesia. Ear disease can be extremely painful, and some cats may not even allow a visual exam without it.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment of ear disease in cats\n\nYour vet may diagnose an ear infection based on how the ear looks and a simple swab of the ear discharge.\n\nA visual exam is extremely important to check that the eardrum is intact, as most ear drops can cause severe side effects if used when the eardrum is not intact.\n\nTreatment will usually involve one or more of the following:\n\nEar cleaners\nTo clean and soothe the ear canal\nHelp break up the wax and allow the medicated drops to be more effective\nSome have antibacterial and antifungal properties\nMedicated ear drops\nUsually contain a combination of antibiotic, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory ingredients.\nRange of different types; some are applied twice daily, some are longer-lasting, up to a week\nOften used after a swab has been taken, once results are known for what type of bacteria or yeast is present\nThe length of course may range from 7 days to 14 days or longer, depending on how severe the infection is or what type of infection is present\nAlways complete the course as advised by your vet\nOral medications\nMay be used if ear drops are not possible due to too much pain or a ruptured eardrum\nOften used if middle or inner ear disease is involved\nMay be used before a course of ear drops to help reduce thickening inside the ear canal\nThe most common are antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications\nSurgery\nSimple procedures such as ear flushing (to thoroughly clean the ears) or removal of foreign bodies\nRemoval of the tip of the ear if severe solar dermatitis is present\nMore complex surgery may be required for ear problems that are not clearing with medical treatment or badly damaged ears\nThere are several different techniques: lateral wall resection, vertical ear canal ablation, and total ear canal ablation (TECA).\n\nOther treatments may be necessary for any of the underlying diseases, such as ear mites. Find out more about the specific treatments for these conditions by following the links to the articles.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with ear disease at home\n\nAlways speak to a vet before using any home remedies for your cat‚Äôs ears. Some products may make the symptoms worse.\n\nMake sure to use any medication as advised by your vet. Do not skip any doses and finish the course. If you are struggling to use the medication, speak to your vet; an alternative may be available. If the problem persists, make sure to take your cat back for a recheck as soon as possible.\nSpeak to a vet as soon as ear problems begin. Ear disease is easier to treat in the beginning, before the ear becomes thickened or develops resistant infections.\nMake sure your cat is up-to-date on parasite preventatives for fleas; these often cover ear mites too.

A study has shown that 1 in every 14 dogs suffers from an ear infection every year in the UK. There are many different causes of ear disease, and some dogs may be affected throughout their whole lives.¬†\n\nEar disease can affect dogs of all ages, but some breeds may be at greater risk. While many cases are quick and easy to clear up, some causes of ear disease can lead to severe pain, and lifelong treatment may be needed. Ear disease is often referred to as otitis, which means inflammation of the ear.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is ear disease in dogs?\n\nEar disease is a common problem that vets see and treat on a daily basis.\n\nThere are many different causes, with bacterial infections and allergies being the most common.\nEar disease can happen at any age.\nInfections are usually caused by reduction of air flow and the build-up of moisture.\nEar disease may be easy to treat if caught early. Simple infections should clear within 1-2 weeks with appropriate treatment.\nIf not treated early, the ear can become damaged and thickened, and treatment becomes difficult.\nSome dogs may need lifelong treatment if they have underlying problems like allergies.\nIt‚Äôs important to investigate for underlying causes; otherwise, the ear problems will continue to return.\nMay affect different parts of the ear: the ear flap and canal (Otitis externa), middle ear (Otitis media) or inner ear (Otitis interna).\nMost cases of middle or inner ear disease are due to bacteria after a ruptured eardrum. Ruptured ear drums are caused by repeated ear infections or incorrect cleaning.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of ear disease in dogs include:\n\nAllergies:¬†Food allergies¬†and environmental\nBacterial and fungal infections\nEar mites\nForeign bodies (such as grass seeds)\nInjuries, such as bites and wounds\nEar growths, such as tumours or polyps\nVestibular disease\nCleaning the ears too often\nAuto-immune conditions\nEndocrine disorders, such as thyroid disease (Hyperthyroidism in dogs)\n\nThese often lead to bacterial and yeast infections in the ears. Severe head shaking can lead to an aural haematoma.\n\n¬†\n\nEar disease can be very painful in dogs, and if not treated quickly, it may lead to lifelong problems. If your dog shows any signs of ear disease, speak to a vet as soon as possible to discuss the next steps.\n\nOur Joii vets are available 24 hours a day if you have any concerns.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of ear disease in dogs\n\nOne or both ears may be affected\n\nEar irritation: scratching at the ears or rubbing them on the floor\nHead shaking\nPain: avoidance or aggression when touched near the head or ears\nRed, inflamed skin inside the ears\nDischarge, such as wax or blood inside the ears\nPhoto of a dog with a red ear\nDog with ear discharge\nHair loss or skin sores around the ears\nA bad smell from the ears\nA head tilt\nLoss of balance\nA swollen ear tip is called an aural haematoma\nPhoto of dog with small aural haematoma\nPhoto of dog with aural haematoma\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of ear disease than others?\n\nAny dog, regardless of age or breed, can develop ear disease.\n\nHowever, there are some breeds that are at greater risk\n\nBasset Hound, Shar-Pei, Labradoodle, Beagle, Golden Retriever, Cockapoo, Spaniels, Bulldogs, Bichon Frise, and Pug\nThese breeds are at higher risk due to a combination of factors, including shape of the ear, having hairy ears, and being prone to skin diseases and allergies.\n\nAnother risk factor is regular exposure to moisture\n\nThis includes dogs that swim, frequent grooming or bathing, and hunting dogs\n\nPuppies and young dogs are more at risk of ear mites.\n\nIs my family at risk of catching ear disease from dogs?\n\nNone of the common causes of ear disease are known to transfer from dogs to humans.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is ear disease diagnosed in dogs?\n\nThe diagnosis of ear disease will usually begin with a full physical exam, including an otoscopic exam. This is where your vet will look down the ear canal with a scope to check the eardrum and check for any abnormalities, such as foreign bodies or growths. Your vet may diagnose an ear infection based on how the ear looks and a simple swab of the ear discharge.\n\nDepending on the findings, further tests may include\n\nA swab of the ear, for cytology, to find out if bacteria, yeast, mites or other cells are present\nA swab may be sent off to see what medication is best to treat the infection\nEar flushing, to clean the ear thoroughly\nA biopsy of any growths in the ear\nImaging: Skull x-rays, CT or MRI may be recommended for certain conditions, especially those affecting the middle and inner ear\nOther tests to check for underlying diseases include diet trials, allergy skin testing, and blood and urine tests.\n\n¬†\n\nThe above tests often require sedation or anaesthesia. Ear disease can be extremely painful, and some dogs may not even allow a visual exam without it.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment of ear disease in dogs\n\nA visual exam is extremely important to check that the eardrum is intact, as most ear drops can cause severe side effects if used when the eardrum is not intact.\n\nTreatment will usually involve one or more of the following\n\nEar cleaners\nTo clean and soothe the ear canal\nHelp break up the wax and allow the medicated drops to be more effective\nSome have antibacterial and antifungal properties\nMedicated ear drops\nUsually contain a combination of antibiotic, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory ingredients.\nRange of different types; some are applied twice daily, some are longer-lasting, up to a week\nOften used after a swab has been taken, once results are known for what type of bacteria or yeast is present\nThe length of course may range from 7 days to 14 days or longer, depending on how severe the infection is or what type of infection is present\nAlways complete the course as advised by your vet\nOral medications\nMay be used if ear drops are not possible due to too much pain or a ruptured eardrum\nOften used if middle or inner ear disease is involved\nMay be used before a course of ear drops to help reduce thickening inside the ear canal\nUsually antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications\nSurgery\nSimple procedures such as ear flushing (to thoroughly clean the ears) or removal of foreign bodies\nMore complex surgery may be required for ear problems that are not clearing with medical treatment or badly damaged ears\nThere are several different techniques: lateral wall resection, vertical ear canal ablation, and total ear canal ablation (TECA).\n\n¬†\n\nOther treatments may be necessary for any of the underlying diseases, such as ear mites. Find out more about the specific treatments for these conditions by following the links to the articles.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with ear disease at home\n\nAlways speak to a vet before using any home remedies for your dog‚Äôs ears. Some products may make the symptoms worse.\n\nMake sure to use any medication as advised by your local vet. Do not skip any doses and finish the course. If you are struggling to use the medication, speak to your vet; an alternative may be available. If the problem persists, make sure to take your dog back for a recheck as soon as possible.\nSpeak to a vet as soon as ear problems begin.

Although it‚Äôs more common in large- and giant-breed dogs, it can also affect small and medium breeds. Dogs with elbow dysplasia often develop arthritis even after surgery, requiring lifelong management.\n\nElbow dysplasia is the name given to a group of conditions that affects the elbow during abnormal growth of the elbow joint. Elbow dysplasia cannot be cured but it can be well managed in order to improve quality of life.\n\nWhat is elbow dysplasia in dogs?\n\nThe elbow joint is made up of three bones that come into contact: the radius, the ulna, and the humerus.\n\nAnatomy of the elbow\n\nIf the bones do not fit together perfectly, different problems can occur.\n\nElbow dysplasia consists of one or more of the following problems:\n\nUnunited anconeal process (UAP): A portion of the ulna bone (the anconeal process) fails to fuse during growth.\nFragmented coronoid process (FCP): The small bony projection on the ulna (the coronoid process) is separated from the rest of the ulna by trauma or growth abnormality. This results in a fragment of bone floating in the elbow joint region.\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD): A piece of cartilage from the surface of the humerus becomes loose within the joint space, resulting in abnormal cartilage wear and pain.\nElbow incongruity: The radius and ulna grow at different rates, resulting in instability of the joint.\n\nIn all cases, elbow dysplasia leads to joint wear, instability, inflammation, and eventually pain and arthritis.\n\nWith treatment, 85% of cases will show some degree of improvement in lameness and comfort despite the progression of arthritis.\n\nWhat are the signs of elbow dysplasia in dogs?\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your dog:\n\nLimping\nStiffness after exercise or after prolonged periods of rest\nHolding the elbow away from the body when walking\n\nSigns often occur in older puppies (5 to 8 months of age). However, it may not be diagnosed until adulthood.\n\nWhich dogs are at risk of elbow dysplasia?\n\nThe cause of elbow dysplasia in dogs remains unclear.\n\nDifferent factors are believed to cause growth disturbances, and consequently elbow dysplasia.\n\nAmong the causes are:\n\nHereditary factors: Commonly seen in large to giant breed dogs such as Bernese Mountain Dogs, German Shepherds, Golden and Labrador Retrievers, among others.\nNutrition: Puppies that grow too quickly or become obese due to inappropriate feeding.\nTrauma: High impact accident that injures the bones and cartilage.\n\nHow vets diagnose elbow dysplasia in dogs\n\nTo help determine whether your dog has elbow dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your dog‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\n\nYour vet may also need to refer your dog to a specialist vet in a referral hospital for more advanced diagnostic procedures such as:\n\nCT scans\nMRI scans\nArthroscopy (a camera inside the joint)\n\nHow to treat elbow dysplasia in dogs\n\nTreatment consists of surgery and medical management.\n\nSurgery is usually necessary. But in these cases, medical management still plays a very important role.\n\nYour vet may recommend only medical treatment if the problem is so mild or severe that routine surgery is unlikely to benefit the joint.\n\n¬†\n\nSurgery\n\nOften surgery is best performed using arthroscopy (using a camera in the joint), but conventional open surgery can also be done.\n\nSurgery may involve the following procedures, depending on the problem:\n\nRemoval of any bone fragments and removal of loose cartilage.\nReattachment or removal of the anconeal process.\nSurgical alteration of the elbow joint to improve joint fit or shift weight away from damaged areas.\nJoint replacement if the elbow is severely damaged.\n\n¬†\n\nMedical management\n\nMedical management is used to minimize pain and slow the progression of arthritis. For better results, all of the following will be needed:\n\nJoint supplements\nAnti-inflammatory and painkiller medication\nWeight control and weight loss\nExercise modification\nPhysiotherapy and rehabilitation\nComplementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage, stem cell therapy, and laser therapy\n\nHow to help your dog with elbow dysplasia at home\nKeep your dog slim\n\nIt is important that your dog maintains an ideal BCS of 4-5 to prevent excessive weight on their joints.\n\nYou can achieve this by:\n\nUsing a weight control diet.\nMaking sure you are given the correct amount and frequency of food per day.\nAvoiding extra treats or choosing healthy and low-calorie treats.\nAvoiding giving human food.\nExercising your dog enough and correctly.\nContacting a vet nurse for guidance.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\n\n¬†\n\nControlled exercise during painful episodes\n\nExercise should be restricted during any flare-up of lameness.\n\nYour dog should not run, jump, use stairs, or have any boisterous activity for a period of three weeks.\n\nWe suggest:\n\nMind/puzzle games to keep them busy\nKeeping your dog on the lead\nShort walks, on average a 10 minutes walk 3-4 times a day\n\n¬†\n\nCold therapy during painful episodes\n\nApplying cold to the elbows after a flare-up of lameness can reduce inflammation and pain in a natural way.\n\nFor most dogs, applying a cold pack to the elbows for 10 minutes, especially after exercise, can be helpful.\n\nWe recommend you contact a vet before applying cold therapy to your dog.\n\n¬†\n\nAdapting activity levels for long-term management\n\nIn the long term, your dog may benefit from short and frequent walks, and you will learn what they can cope with.\n\nThe following guidelines are recommended:\n\nAdapt your routine.\nAvoid vigorous off-lead exercise, which will put excessive stress on their elbows.\nExercise patterns should be regular: avoid short walks during the week and long walks during the weekend.\nAvoid hard, irregular landscapes and soft sand beaches. Choose flat, short grass instead.\nAvoid tricky obstacles\nConserve energy to get home\nTake a break during the walk\nSo many joint supplements are available, which one should you choose?\n\nThe key ingredient a joint supplement should contain is:\n\nGreen-lipped mussel extract (a bivalve mollusc extract)\nOmega-3&6 fatty acids (polyunsaturated fatty acids)\n\nOther ingredients that may also have an effect are:\n\nDPLA (a protein that is believed to have pain relief and mood-elevating effects)\nSAMe (a compound found naturally in the body)\nCBD (an active ingredient in cannabis extracted from the hemp plant)\nHyaluronic acid (a component of joint fluid that gives it elasticity)\nChondroitin sulphate (extracted from mammalian cartilage, normally cow windpipes)\nCollagen hydrolysates (also known as gelatin, it‚Äôs made from collagenous structures of mammals such as bovine tendons)\nGlucosamine (a natural compound found in cartilage)\nVitamin E\n\n¬†\n\nAre physiotherapy and rehabilitation that important?\n\nIn order to improve limb function and quality of life, this condition typically requires expensive surgery and physiotherapy.\n\nUse the following links to find qualified professionals\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal, Practitioners (RAMP),¬† The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\nHydrotherapy: National Association of Registered Canine Hydrotherapists, Canine Hydrotherapy Association\nLaser therapy\nAcupuncture: Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\nMagnetic field therapy\nChiropathy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), British Veterinary Chiropractic Association (BVCA)\nOsteopathy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), European Veterinary Society for Osteopathy (EVSO)\nMassage\nHomoeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\nElectrohydraulic shockwave therapy\n\nCan elbow dysplasia in dogs be prevented?\n\nNot all cases of elbow dysplasia can be prevented.

Around 1 in 500 cats in the UK have more than one seizure. One quarter of these have epilepsy. It‚Äôs most common in adult to middle-aged cats. Severity, treatment and outlook depend on the underlying cause.¬†\n\nSeizures happen when there‚Äôs an uncontrolled flare of electrical activity in your cat‚Äôs brain. Epilepsy means your cat has repeated seizures. Seizures look scary, but they‚Äôre not painful, and they usually only last a minute or two. However, your cat may seem sleepy and out of sorts for several hours afterwards. Seizures are exhausting. They can damage both the body and the brain if they last too long or happen multiple times in a short period of time. There‚Äôs no cure for epilepsy. However, with veterinary care and daily medication to prevent seizures, many cats continue to enjoy a full and active life at home.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is epilepsy in cats?\n\nEpilepsy in cats is caused by an abnormality of the brain.\n\nThis abnormality causes seizures, which may be general (whole body) or partial. Not all cats who have an unexplained seizure have epilepsy. Cats may have a single seizure and never have another in their lifetime.\n\nThere are 3 types of epilepsy in cats:\n\nIdiopathic Epilepsy\nCauses seizures without structural changes in the brain or an obvious cause\nMuch less common than in dogs.\nIs an inherited (genetic) disease in dogs. Less certain in cats.\nStructural Epilepsy\nSeizures where there is damage to the structure of the brain\nCauses of damage include head trauma, inflammation of the brain (FIV, FeLV, Toxoplasmosis, FIP, Rabies, meningitis), a stroke, a brain tumour or a birth defect\nEpilepsy of unknown cause\nA structural cause is suspected but not identified with testing\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of epilepsy in cats\n\nThere can be up to four stages associated with epilepsy in cats:\n\n¬†\n\nEarly warning phase or ‚ÄòProdrome‚Äô\n\nSome cats develop behaviour changes in the hours or days before an epileptic seizure.\n\nSymptoms are vague and variable but can include:\n\nRestlessness\nAttention-seeking\nAnxious behaviour\n\nVets call this the ‚Äòprodrome‚Äô.\n\n¬†\n\nImmediately before the seizure ‚Äì the ‚ÄòAura‚Äô\n\nShortly before a seizure, cats may experience an aura. Signs, if present, are the same as the prodrome.\n\n¬†\n\nThe seizure or ‚ÄòIctus‚Äô\n\nSeizures in cats can be focal (partial) or whole body (complete or generalised).\n\nSymptoms of a focal or partial seizure include:\n\nTwitching face muscles and trembling\nDrooling\nRapid running\nDilated pupils\nPassing poo or wee\n\nSymptoms of a whole body seizure:\n\nBecoming unsteady, losing balance\nFalling over, with stiffened muscles\nBecoming vacant or unconscious\nLying on one side and jerking their limbs\nDrooling saliva\nMaking chomping and biting movements\nPassing faeces (poo) or urine (wee) without being aware of it\n\nSeizures usually only last for a minute or two.\n\nFocal seizures may rapidly develop into full body ones.\n\nProlonged seizures are dangerous.\n\nCall¬† your nearest vet immediately if your cat‚Äôs seizure has been going on for longer than 3 minutes\n\n¬†\n\nAfter a seizure ‚Äì the ‚ÄòPost Ictal phase‚Äô¬†\n\nAfter a seizure, your cat may be:\n\nAggressive\nDisorientated\nVery hungry and thirsty\nSeeming blind or deaf\nLooking wobbly or ‚Äòdrunk‚Äô\n\nThis is known as the post-ictal phase. Ictus is another name for a seizure. It‚Äôs best to leave your cat to recover safely and peacefully in their familiar surroundings until this passes.\n\nThere can be many other symptoms of ‚Äòfull‚Äô or ‚Äòpartial‚Äô seizures.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of Epilepsy than others?\nEpilepsy is most common in adult to middle-aged cats\nBreed, size and sex don‚Äôt affect the likelihood of epilepsy in cats\nAre my Family and other pets at risk?\n\nEpilepsy is caused by an abnormality in the brain of an individual cat.\n\nIt cannot spread between cats or from cats to their owners and other pets in the household.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is epilepsy diagnosed?\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a single test for epilepsy.\n\nVets gather information and use the following tests to find the cause of seizures:\n\nHistory: your account of what happened and your cat‚Äôs general health\nGeneral and neurological examination: checking things like balance and eyesight\nBlood and urine tests to check for liver or kidney disease, low blood sugar or abnormal electrolyte (salt) levels. All of these can cause seizures. Finding a cause like this means the seizure is not idiopathic epilepsy\nMRI or CT scans: vets may recommend a closer examination of your cat‚Äôs brain using advanced tests to check the brain‚Äôs structure.\nTests on samples of fluid taken from around the brain, called the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF.\n\nThese tests may reveal a cause of Structural epilepsy.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy is diagnosed when cats have repeated seizures and tests don‚Äôt identify an underlying cause.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat cats with epilepsy?\n\nAlthough the disease cannot be cured, with the right medication and veterinary care,¬†many cats with epilepsy can go on to live full and active lives. The outlook will depend on what caused the epilepsy.\n\nOutlook is best for cats with idiopathic epilepsy (unknown cause)\n\n¬†\n\nEmergency treatment in practice\n\nIn emergencies, vets inject sedatives and anti-seizure medicine directly into your cat‚Äôs veins to control seizures.\n\nAn emergency is a seizure which lasts more than 3 minutes or happens repeatedly in a short period.\n\n¬†\n\nPrescription treatment for Epilepsy at home\n\nLonger-term treatment for idiopathic epilepsy includes:\n\nAnti-seizure medicine given daily as tablets or liquid\nEmergency medication for at home treatment of seizures lasting more than 3 minutes\n\nMedicine by mouth for epilepsy:\n\nFirst-line choices:\n\nPhenobarbitone\nPotassium Bromide\nImepitoin\n\nAdditional medication is prescribed if your cat‚Äôs seizures aren‚Äôt controlled well enough by the above:\n\nLevetiracetam\nZonisamide\nGabapentin\n\n¬†\n\nEmergency treatment at home\n\nIf your cat has epilepsy, your vet may give you medicine to use at home to control seizures which go on too long.\n\nRectal Diazepam ‚Äì given into your cat‚Äôs bottom for rapid effect\n\n¬†\n\nCaring for a cat with epilepsy at home\nThere are no home remedies for epilepsy in cats\n\nCats with epilepsy need lifelong treatment with prescription medicine from a vet.\n\nMedication for epilepsy can have side effects. If your cat is being treated for epilepsy, they will need to see a vet for regular check-ups. This should be at least every 6 months.\n\nRegular check-ups include:\n\nIdentifying frequency of seizures and any changes in general health\nPhysical examination\nBlood tests\nChecking levels of phenobarbitone\nChecking for evidence of liver damage or other health concerns\n\n¬†\n\nTips for living with a cat with epilepsy:\nWhat to do if you think your pet is having a seizure\nStay calm\nTurn down the lights\nKeep the room quiet\nTry not to touch your cat during the seizure\nRemove children and other pets from the room\nKeep your cat safe from injuring themselves\nCare! Avoid risk of injury if aggression is part of your cat‚Äôs seizure\n\nCall your nearest vet if your cat‚Äôs seizure is lasting more than 3 minutes¬†\n\nSpeak to a vet if your cat has more than one seizure in a day.\n\nHow can you tell if a seizure is about to happen?\n\nSome pets with epilepsy show changes in behaviour in the time leading up to a seizure. This is the and may happen up to an hour or even several days before the seizure itself.\n\nYou may learn to recognise these cues in your cat and be able to create a safe environment.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurning down the lights\nTurning off the television or music\nTurning off the heating ‚Äì pets can overheat during seizures\nCovering hard corners and edges of furniture with cushions\nTaking other pets and children to a different room\n\nThese steps will reduce stimulation of your pet‚Äôs brain. This helps to reduce the electrical stimulation feeding into the seizure.\n\nIf seizures happen regularly, your vet may prescribe a sedative medication to give into your pet‚Äôs mouth or bottom. This medicine may be used either for:\n\nControlling a seizure lasting longer than 3-5 minutes, or\nReducing the severity of a seizure (or preventing it completely) if an aura allows you to recognise when a seizure is about to happen.\n\n¬†\n\nCan epilepsy be prevented?\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy can‚Äôt be prevented or cured.\n\nGive prescribed medication from your vet at the right time and the prescribed dose\nDon‚Äôt give supplements or herbal remedies without consulting a vet.

This is a common and contagious disease that can also result in eye problems. In healthy cats, it is usually not serious, unlike in kittens and adult cats with underlying illnesses.\n\nCat flu is also called Feline Upper Respiratory Disease Complex. Cats can catch this virus through direct contact with an infected cat or contaminated objects. The illness is typically brief, lasting from 7 to 21 days. Yet, some cats can develop life-long or recurrent signs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is cat flu?\n\nCat flu is a general term for a disease with symptoms that involve the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat) and eyes. These include sneezing, a snotty nose, and weepy eyes.\n\nCat flu can be caused by two types of viruses (calcivirus and herpes virus) and two types of bacteria (Bordetella bronchiseptica¬†and¬†Chlamydophila felis).\n\nCats infected with herpes virus become lifetime carriers and have symptoms of cat flu on and off throughout their life.\n\nThis disease spreads very easily, usually through sneezing. Cat flu carriers may still spread the disease, despite looking healthy.\n\nThere are vaccines available.¬† This is not a guaranteed defence but will make them more resistant to the disease.\n\nCat flu is usually viral, meaning that antibiotics won‚Äôt be effective in most cases.\n\nSince kittens can be severely affected, we recommend you contact a vet if you suspect they have cat flu.\n\nBordetella bronchiseptica is the bacteria that causes kennel cough in dogs.\n\nRespiratory tract anatomy in cats\n\nSymptoms of cat flu\nSneezing\nSnotty nose\nWeepy eyes\nRed eyes\nSquinting eyes\nCoughing\nFever\nDifficulty breathing\nNoisy breathing\nLack of appetite\nDifficulty eating\nTiredness\n\n¬†\n\nIs your cat at risk?\n\nYoung cats, elderly cats, and cats with other illnesses¬†can be more prone to showing signs of disease. This is mainly because their immune system isn‚Äôt very strong.\n\nCats living in a high population density, such as cat shelters or multi-cat households, can also be more likely to catch this.\n\nBefore taking your cat to a cattery, make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations.\n\nIf you are a dog owner too and your dog has been diagnosed with kennel cough, it is better to keep cat and dog separate.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is cat flu diagnosed?\n\nVets usually diagnose cat flu based on:\n\nHistory taking\nCat‚Äôs symptoms\nHands-on examination\n\nOn some occasions, vets may need to do further testing, such as:\n\nDye test on the eye\nTear production test\nTesting for viruses\nBacterial culture and sensitivity testing\nBlood tests to check for other illnesses affecting the body\nTaking x-rays\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for cat flu?\n\nMost cases of cat flu are mild and easily managed with medication to ease symptoms.\n\nThere is no cure for cat flu caused by herpes virus, but there are many things that can reduce the symptoms and help the body fight the infection.\n\nThe treatment may differ in mild and severe cases and may include some of the following:\n\nEye drops or ointments\nAnti-inflammatories\nOral antiviral medications\nAntibiotics (if bacterial infections are present or pneumonia is suspected)\nAppetite stimulants\nMedication that stimulates the immune system\nHumidifiers or nasal saline drops to help with nasal congestion\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with flu at home\n\nFollowing your vet‚Äôs treatment recommendations\n\nClean their eyes and nose\n\nThis will help them smell their food and breathe more easily.\nUse cotton wool soaked in warm water to wipe any discharge from their eyes and nose.\n\nHelp them breathe better¬†\n\nPlace them in a steamy room (i.e. the bathroom while you‚Äôre showering).

Stress and intense exercise commonly cause fast breathing, but if these are not the cause or the breathing isn‚Äôt returning to normal, a serious condition may be present.\n\nMost cats will only breathe with their mouth open if they are very stressed or have a serious problem. Normal breathing movements in cats are very subtle and silent. Any breathing changes lasting more than a few minutes should be discussed with a vet, and this is urgent if the breathing is getting worse or if it is noisy or laboured.\n\nRecording breaths per minute at rest is a useful way to monitor chronic conditions, especially those affecting the heart and lungs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my cat is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and remove anything that may cause stress for your cat. If your cat has been showing other signs of not being well it is advisable to contact a vet. This is urgent if the breathing is getting worse.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of fast breathing in cats\n\nStress and fear\n\nExercise, especially in warm weather\n\nFever\n\nPain\n\nAsthma\n\nAirway infections such as cat flu or pneumonia\n\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes\n\nAnaemia\n\nHeart disease or other causes of pulmonary oedema\n\nInfection or fluid around the lungs, called pleural effusion\n\nForeign bodies in the airways\n\nPulmonary trauma or diaphragmatic hernial, can happen due to road traffic accidents, falls or other trauma)\n\nLungworm or other parasites in the respiratory tract\n\nSevere tummy swelling\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about fast breathing\n\nThe normal breathing rate for cats is around 20-30 breaths per minute at rest. This can increase a lot with exercise or stress but should return to normal in minutes.\n\nTake your cat to an emergency vet straight away if:\n\nGums or tongue look blue, purple or pale\nYou can see something obstructing the airway that cannot be safely removed\nYour cat is breathing with the mouth open, especially if the neck is outstretched and the front limbs are spread apart\nBreathing is noisy, especially if wheezing is present\nThe abdomen is moving noticeably when they breathe\nYour cat is not acting normal\n\n¬†\n\nPrevention tips to avoid fast breathing in cats\n\nNeutering may reduce roaming and help prevent accidents and injuries.\n\nVaccinations will limit the risk of some infections that cause airway disease.\n\nRegular monitoring and treatment may prevent some complications from chronic heart and lung disease.\n\nLungworm is becoming more common all over the UK. It is more common in dogs, but cats can also be affected. Other parasites can be contracted during hunting and roaming. Regular deworming, flea and mite control with good quality products can prevent problems.\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of fast breathing in cats\n\nIf your cat‚Äôs breathing rate is increased, your vet will:\n\nexamine your cat\nlisten to their chest\ncheck their temperature\nrecommend blood tests\ndiscuss x-rays and scans\n\n¬†\n\nHome remedies for fast breathing in cats\n\nThere are no home treatments for fast breathing in cats.\n\nIf your cat has started breathing fast suddenly and is not recovering quickly, please take your cat to see a vet immediately.\n\nTake their respiratory rate while they are asleep. This means counting how many breaths they take in one minute.\n\nIf their breathing isn‚Äôt settling down and they are showing other signs of being unwell, please contact a vet as soon as possible.\n\nIf your cat has an underlying condition, please give medications as advised by your vet.\n\nReport any changes in their condition back to your vet as soon as possible.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for fast breathing in cats\n\nBy the time breathing changes become obvious, cats are usually oxygen deprived and need to have oxygen administered to them. This is usually done by placing them in a special box with high levels of oxygen flowing through it.\n\nIf there is fluid around the lungs, this will need to be drained. This procedure is called thoracocentesis.\n\nIf the airway is collapsed or there is an obstruction that cannot be immediately removed, a tube may need to be inserted directly into the windpipe, via tracheostomy.\n\nAsthma is treated with bronchodilators and steroids, either by nebulisation (a small machine used to give medication as a mist) or injection.\n\nInfections are usually treated with antibiotics.\n\nFever is usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPain is treated with analgesic medications such as opioids.\n\nTrauma to the chest or abdomen may require emergency surgery.\n\nPulmonary oedema, fluid in the lungs, is treated with diuretics.\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk for breathing problems\n\nSiamese and Oriental cats are at higher risk for asthma, mediastinal lymphoma (a type of cancer) and chylothorax (a type of fluid build-up in the chest)\n\nMaine Coons and Ragdolls are at higher risk for some types of heart disease\n\nCats that roam and fight are at higher risk for trauma and infection\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of fast breathing\n\nHeat stroke is rare in cats but possible in extreme conditions, such as in cars\n\nParacetamol is very toxic to cats and disrupts their red blood cells, causing breathing problems\n\nPulmonary thromboembolism\n\nTumours/cancer\n\nHead trauma\n\nUrinary tract rupture\n\n 2\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This can increase dramatically during or after exercise but should return to normal within minutes. If breathing appears difficult or if your dog appears distressed or restless, please seek help straight away. Abnormal noises, stretched-out neck, strong abdominal movements or a change in the colour of your dog‚Äôs gums are other signs that there is a serious problem.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if my dog is breathing fast\n\nTry to stay calm and avoid things your dog may find stressful or exciting. Ensure they are in a cool and well-ventilated area, if possible.\n\nIt is always advisable to get a vet to check if your dog‚Äôs breathing has changed. The faster the change, the more urgent the problem is.\n\nIf the weather is very hot and you are concerned about heat stroke, please see further advice here\n\nA gradual increase in breaths per minute while resting may be an early warning sign that conditions like heart disease or bronchitis are getting worse.

Around 1% of all cats and 15% of itchy cats have food allergies. The most common signs of food allergies are itchy skin, ear infections, and stomach upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea.¬†\n\nFood allergies are also called cutaneous adverse food reactions or food hypersensitivity. They cannot be cured but can be managed well, and cats can live a full, happy life. Some cats may need medication to help with severe flare-ups, but most can be managed with a special diet alone.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are food allergies in cats?\n\nThe cause of these allergies is an overreaction of the immune system to a food or ingredient that it has already been exposed to.\n\nAny ingredient, but most commonly the protein source (i.e. chicken, dairy, or fish) can cause a reaction.\nYour cat can be allergic to one or more ingredients in their food.\nA food allergy involves the immune system, whereas a food intolerance does not. Food intolerances are more common and tend to be less severe.\nFood allergies can occur at any age, even if they have been on the same food for years.\nOnce the allergy has developed, it cannot be cured but can be managed to stop or reduce the symptoms.\n\nFood allergies can cause severe symptoms. If you suspect your cat has any allergies, speak to a vet for advice and to form a treatment plan to help improve their health.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of food allergies in cats\n\nIt‚Äôs not always easy to tell if your cat has food allergies. The signs might not be seen daily, can be vague, and are often linked to other allergies.\n\nSkin signs often start around the head, face, and neck and include\n\nItchy skin and overgrooming\nHair loss, red skin, rash, ulcers and plaques\nSwollen lip or chin\n\nSigns can affect other parts of the body too\n\nItchy ears and ear infections\nGastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, soft stools or diarrhoea, hairballs and weight loss\nLethargy\nRespiratory signs such as sneezing, wheezing, rhinitis, or asthma.\n\nFind out more about what else can make your cat itchy\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of food allergies than others?\n\nFood allergies can affect cats of all ages, breeds, and sexes. The following may be more at risk:\n\nBreeds: Siamese and Siamese crosses.\nAge: It can occur at any age but is more common in younger cats (in up to 50% of cases, signs start when they are under 3 years old).\nDamage to the intestinal tract from previous surgery, infection, certain medications or inflammation can increase the risk of food allergies\n\n¬†\n\nHow are food allergies diagnosed in cats?\n\nThe diagnosis of food allergies can be tricky, and it is often a process of elimination. Cats may have other illnesses that are linked, such as environmental allergies (atopy) or flea allergies.\n\nThe following tests can help rule out other conditions:\n\nA thorough physical examination\nSkin scrapes, hair plucks and skin biopsy\nBlood and urine tests\nIntradermal allergy testing\nImaging of the abdomen, such as x-rays or an ultrasound\nStool tests\n\n¬†\n\nElimination diet trial\n\nAn elimination diet trial is used to diagnose food allergies in cats:\n\nOutdoor cats will need to kept indoors throughout the trial.\nA hydrolysed protein diet is used for at least 6‚Äì8 weeks to assess the response.\nNo other food, including treats, supplements or chews, should be fed during the trial.\nNovel protein diets may be used instead. A novel protein is one that your cat has never been exposed to before.\nIf the symptoms resolve during the trial, it indicates a food allergy. A re-introduction challenge to their old food which causes the symptoms to return confirms the diagnosis.\nPartial improvement of the symptoms indicates that there is not only a food allergy but also a concurrent allergy to something else.\nAt the end of the trial, a veterinarian can advise you on the next steps.\n\nMost foods that are used for food trials can be used long-term too.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for food allergies in cats\n\nAllergies in cats can be very complex. A multimodal approach is often needed to treat allergies. This involves using different products, including special food, medications, and supplements, to help control the symptoms.\n\nInitially, your cat may need:\n\nAnti-itch medication, such as steroids, anti-histamines, and Atopica.\nAntibiotics for any skin, ear or gastrointestinal infections\nParasite control for any fleas or mites\nPain relief\n\nOnce under control, most cats with only food allergies can be managed alone with a special diet.\n\nIf the condition is complicated or not responding to treatment, your vet might refer your cat to a skin specialist (Dermatologist).\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with food allergies at home\n\nFeed your cat a complete and balanced diet in the long term, avoiding any known allergens, such as:\n\nHydrolysed protein diets contain proteins that are broken down into tiny pieces to avoid an immune reaction.

Passing hairballs 2-3 times a year is normal, but if it happens more frequently it is not. All adult cats, except for hairless breeds, can get hairballs.\n\nHairballs can also be called furballs and trichobezoars. They can be so common in cats that they‚Äôre almost considered normal. Cats bring them up when hair accumulates in their stomach. Hairballs are easy to manage when they happen occasionally. But frequent hairballs may signal an underlying health problem.\n\n¬†\n\nCauses of hairballs in cats\n\nCats swallow hair when grooming. This hair should pass out in their poo. But if cats eat too much hair or if it can‚Äôt pass through their intestines normally, it builds up in their stomach.\n\nWe may see cats passing hairballs often if they are overgrooming due to:\n\nPain in their tummy or joints\nGastrointestinal problems that cause a delay in passing the hair\nItchy skin and hair loss, due to allergies, fungal infections or parasites, such as fleas and mites\nBehavioural problems, such as stress and anxiety\nEating prey\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of hairballs in cats\n\nThe signs cats show when having problems with hairballs are often confused with respiratory problems.

They happen if dogs swallow too much hair. Hairballs can cause obstructions in the intestine if left untreated. But mild cases are resolved with common laxative pastes.\n\nHairballs or trichobezoars result from overgrooming. Symptoms include gagging, retching and vomiting. Mild cases resolve easily with laxatives. Hairballs can also cause obstructions in the intestine and may need surgery to be removed.\n\n¬†\n\nCauses of hairballs in dogs\n\nDogs swallow hair when grooming. This should pass through their intestines (tummy) and come out in their poo. But if they eat too much hair or if the hair doesn‚Äôt pass through normally, it may accumulate in their stomach.

It occurs when your cat‚Äôs internal body temperature is higher than normal. It is less common in cats compared to dogs, but they are still at risk.¬†\n\nHeat stroke requires immediate attention, or it can be fatal. If symptoms develop, remove your cat from the heat or sun, start cooling down, and contact your local vet. The most common cause is due to overheating during play or exercise.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat has heat stroke\n\nAct calmly and quickly. With heat stroke, the faster the treatment, the more likely a full recovery is.\n\nStop any exercise and move immediately into a shaded and cool area.\nTry to keep your cat as relaxed as possible, stress can worsen the problem.\nAllow access to cool fresh water for drinking.\nApply or spray cool water (tap water around 15-16‚ÑÉ) slowly on the body. Especially the tummy and inner thighs. You can use a cloth or towel to do this but do not leave the cloth on the body. Avoid the nose and mouth area.\nUse a fan to cool or open all the windows to create a breeze.\n\nGet your cat to your nearest vet practice as soon as possible. Make sure to use the air conditioning in the car or open all the windows.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is heat stroke in cats?\n\nHeat stroke can also be known as hyperthermia, sunstroke, or heat-related illness.\n\nNormal body temperature for cats should be between 38 and 39.2‚ÑÉ (101-102.5‚Ñâ). Heat stroke symptoms usually occur above 40‚ÑÉ.\nThe most common cause is due to overheating during play or exercise.\nIt can also be caused by sitting in the sun or heat for too long. This can be outdoors, inside a vehicle, or in a building.\nWe mostly see this problem during the warm summer months, but it can happen at any time of the year.\nHeat stroke can affect cats of all ages, genders, and breeds. Brachycephalic (short-snouted) cats are much more likely to suffer from the condition.\nBrachycephalic cats are more at risk of heat stroke\n\n¬†\n\nCats are different from humans in the way they cool themselves down. Instead of having sweat glands all over the body, they can only sweat through the paw pads. They cool down by cleaning themselves, shedding, and stretching out in cool areas. Panting can help cool the body down, but this can also be one of the first symptoms we see with heat stroke.\n\nA rise in the body temperature can lead to serious damage to the internal organs. This can result in internal bleeding, coma, and death.\nImmediate treatment is vital. The longer the body temperature is too high, the more damage there is to the body‚Äôs organs and tissues.\n\nHeat stroke is not the same as having a high temperature or Fever, which are normally due to infections.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of heat stroke in cats\n\nYour cat may show one, some, or all of the following signs of heat stroke\n\nExcessive panting or difficulty breathing\nDrooling, foaming at the mouth\nShaking, agitation, or lethargy\nBright red or very pale gums\nVomiting or¬†Diarrhoea\nReluctance to move and weakness, muscle tremors\nConfusion, seizures, loss of consciousness, or collapse\nDrooling and mouth breathing are common signs of heat stroke\n\nAre some cats more at risk of heat stroke than others?\n\nThe following traits can mean your cat is more prone to developing heat stroke:\n\nObesity\nVery young or older cats\nThick, long, or heavy fur\nUnderlying heart, lung, or airway problems, including feline asthma\nCats with paw pad disease\nParticular breeds: Persians, Scottish Folds, and Himalayans\n\n¬†\n\nHow is heat stroke diagnosed in cats?\n\nDiagnosis is based on the symptoms and history of recent exercise or being in a warm environment.\n\nA high temperature on arrival at the vet practice also confirms this diagnosis. This may not always be present if cooling treatment has been started at home.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for heat stroke in cats?\n\nIf you suspect your cat has heat stroke, it is vital that you take them to your local vet for treatment immediately.\n\nFurther medications and treatments may be necessary depending on the symptoms:\n\nFluids via a drip to help with cooling and protect vital organs.\nMedications to stop any seizures.\nBlood and urine tests to check certain organs for damage.\nOther treatments such as oxygen, sedation, tummy protectants, and antibiotics may be necessary.\n\nYour cat may need to be hospitalised for several days. Once stable, they will be allowed home, but they will need careful monitoring.

Cats with hip dysplasia can develop secondary osteoarthritis¬†of the affected joint. Maine Coon, Persian, and Himalayan breeds are more likely to develop hip dysplasia, although it can affect any cat.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHip dysplasia is caused by abnormal development of the hip while the cat is growing. Signs of hip dysplasia in cats are often gradual, making them difficult\n\nto spot. The start of signs can vary between 3 months and 3.5 years of age.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hip dysplasia in cats?\n\nThe hips are ‚Äúball and socket‚Äù joints, which normally fit together perfectly to allow easy movement.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia in cats is an inherited problem that is not well understood by the scientific community.\n\nThe socket (acetabulum) of the hip commonly appears shallowed, resulting in the loosening of the hip joint, which causes dysfunction and pain.\n\nAs the cat grows, the cartilage and bone of the hip begin to wear down. Over time, this disease leads to arthritis¬†of the affected joint, muscle loss, and limited mobility.\n\nIn the short term, most cats with hip dysplasia will make an improvement when they are managed appropriately.\n\nLong-term improvements are not always as successful.\n\nThe majority of cats in later life will have ongoing exercise restrictions and require medications.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to identify the signs of hip dysplasia in cats¬†\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your cat:¬†\n\nLess active\nLimping that is worse after exercise\nDifficulty climbing\nReluctance to jump\nInability or reluctance to climb stairs\nWalking in a crouched position\nHowling while resting\nReluctance to squat to poop\n\nThe onset of signs of disease is variable, starting between 3 months and 3.5 years of age.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of hip dysplasia than others?\n\nGenetics is the main risk factor for this condition.¬†\n\nMaine Coon, Persian, and Himalayan breeds tend to be more likely to develop hip dysplasia, although it can affect any cat.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow to diagnose hip dysplasia in cats\n\nTo help determine whether your cat has hip dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your cat‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination¬†\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\nEvaluate how loose the hip joint is by manipulating it under sedation or general anaesthesia\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat hip dysplasia in cats\n\nTreatment for hip dysplasia depends on many factors, but the most important is the severity of the condition.¬†\n\nYour vet might recommend one or more of the following treatment options:\n\nWeight management\nPrescription medications\nSupplements¬†\nAlternative therapies\nIntra articular interventions\nControlled exercise in acute episodes\nSurgery\nWeight management¬†\n\nIt is important that your cat is kept at an ideal body condition score of 4-5/9 to prevent excessive weight on their joints. Vet nurses can help you with this.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\nMedications¬†\n\nThe choice of medication is made on an individual basis, and various drugs may be tried before finding the most effective one.¬†\n\nAnti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)¬†\nGabapentin¬†\nAmantadine\nCodeine\nTramadol\nAmitriptyline\nJoint supplements¬†\n\nVeterinary-approved nutritional supplements have been shown to:\n\nDecrease inflammation within the joints\nSlow the progression of arthritis\nImprove general mobility¬†\nDecreasing the amount of anti-inflammatory medication required¬†\n\nThe key ingredient a joint supplement should contain is: marine-based sources of omega 3 (such as green-lipped mussels), other ingredients like glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid may also be beneficial.¬†\n\nAlternatively, there are foods available that already contain joint supplements.\n\nNote that many supplements available online and in pet shops do not have proven health benefits.

    "text": "Overview\nSymptoms\nRisk\nDiagnosis\nVet treatment\nHome treatment\nPrevention\nWhen to worry\nüê∂ in dogs üê± in cats\nHip dysplasia in dogs\nWritten by Dr. Carolina Paz\non June 10, 2023\n\nHip dysplasia is an inherited disease. Dogs with hip dysplasia develop secondary osteoarthritis of the affected joint. Large-breed dogs are more likely to develop this condition, although it can affect dogs of any size or breed.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia may be associated with hip joint laxity and hip subluxation.¬† This disease is caused by abnormal development of the hip while the dog is growing. A system has been implemented to check for hip dysplasia before breeding dogs. This reduces the number of puppies born with this painful condition.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hip dysplasia in dogs?\n\nThe hips are ‚Äúball and socket‚Äù joints, which normally fit together perfectly to allow easy movement.¬†\n\nHip dysplasia is an inherited problem where there‚Äôs a tendency to develop loose hips early in life, resulting in dysfunction and pain.\n\nThis abnormal development of the hips can be caused by genetics, nutrition and hormones.¬†\n\nAs the dog grows, the cartilage and bones of the hip begin to wear down. Over time, this causes arthritis, muscle loss, and limited mobility.\n\nIn the short term, most dogs with hip dysplasia will improve when they‚Äôre managed properly.\n\nLong-term improvements aren‚Äôt always as successful.\n\nIt is common for dogs to live to an old age with exercise restrictions and medication.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to identify the signs of hip dysplasia in dogs¬†\n\nYou might notice some or all of the following in your dog:¬†\n\nLimping on one or both of the hind limbs¬†\nBunny-hopping: running/walking with both back legs moving together\nA swaying walk\nDifficulty jumping or walking upstairs¬†\nStiffness or limping after exercise¬†\nDifficulty rising after periods of rest\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of hip dysplasia than others?\n\nHip dysplasia can occur in any size dog.\n\nLarge-breed dogs: are more prone, such as German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Alaskan Malamutes, Newfoundland, Old English Sheepdogs, Rottweilers, Saint Bernards, and Samoyeds.\n\nNutrition: large-breed puppies with excessive calcium in their food. Puppies that grow too quickly or become obese due to inappropriate feeding.\n\nHormones: there is some evidence that puppies that are neutered while their bones are still growing may be more likely to develop hip dysplasia.\n\nExcessive exercise during puppyhood does not necessarily contribute to the development of hip dysplasia.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow to diagnose hip dysplasia in dogs\n\nHip dysplasia is usually diagnosed between 6 and 12 months of age.\n\nTo help determine whether your dog has hip dysplasia, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your dog‚Äôs life\nDo an orthopaedic examination¬†\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\nEvaluate the hip laxity by manipulating the joint under sedation or under general anaesthesia\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat hip dysplasia in dogs\n\nTreatment for hip dysplasia depends on many factors, but the most important is the severity of the condition.¬† Your vet might recommend one or more of the following treatment options:\n\nWeight Management\nPrescription Medications\nSupplements¬†\nComplementary/Alternative Therapies\nIntra Articular Interventions\nControlled Exercise In Acute Onsets\nSurgery\nWeight management¬†\n\nIt is important that your dog is kept at an ideal body condition score of 4-5 to prevent excessive weight on their joints. Vet nurses can help you with this.\n\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\nMedications¬†\n\nThe choice of medication is made on an individual basis, and various drugs may be tried before finding the most effective one.¬†\n\nThe most commonly used are:\n\nAnti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)\n\nFollowed by other pain relief used together or as a stand-alone:\n\nGabapentin\nAmantadine\nParacetamol\nCodeine\nTramadol\nAmitriptyline\nJoint supplements¬†\n\nVeterinary-approved nutritional supplements have been shown to:\n\nDecrease inflammation within the joints\nSlow the progression of arthritis¬†\nImprove general mobility¬†\nDecrease the amount of anti-inflammatory medication required¬†\n\nThe key ingredient a joint supplement should contain is: marine-based sources of omega 3 (such as green lipped mussels). Other ingredients like glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid may also be beneficial.¬†\n\nAlternatively, there are foods available that already contain joint supplements.\n\nNote that many supplements available online and in pet shops do not have proven health benefits. If you need guidance speak to a vet.\n\nComplementary/alternative therapies\n\nComplementary therapies are often used alongside conventional treatment to help control hip dysplasia and arthritis symptoms.\n\nBelow are the various options. Use the following links as a useful tool to find qualified professionals.\n\nHydrotherapy: National Association of Registered Canine Hydrotherapists , Canine Hydrotherapy Association\n\nPhysiotherapy: The Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners (RAMP), The Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy (ACPAT), National Association of Veterinary Physiotherapists (NAVP)\n\nLaser Therapy\n\nAcupuncture: Association of British Veterinary Acupuncturists\n\nHomeopathy: British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons\n\nIntra articular treatments\n\nThis is a local joint injection that aims to help with arthritis caused by hip dysplasia. There are many different intra-articular injection treatments:¬†\n\nSteroids¬†\nHyaluronic Acid¬†\nPlatelet-rich plasma¬†\nStem Cells\nHydrogels¬†\n\nUnfortunately, there is still insufficient scientific work to encourage the use of these treatments more frequently.¬†\n\nControlled exercise during painful episodes\n\nExercise should be restricted during any flare-up of lameness.¬†\n\nYour dog should not run, jump, climb stairs, or have any boisterous activity for a period of 3 weeks.\n\nSurgical management\n\nIf your dog has severe hip dysplasia that doesn‚Äôt respond to daily management, your vet may suggest surgery.\n\nThere are a few different surgical options, such as:¬†\n\nJuvenile pubic symphysiodesis¬†\nTriple pelvic osteotomy¬†\nTotal hip replacement¬†\nFemoral head and neck excision¬†\n\nYour vet will help you select the most suitable surgery on an individual basis.

do is:\n\nKeep your dog slim¬†\nControlled exercise in acute onsets¬†\nCold therapy during painful episodes\nAdapt activity levels for long-term management\n\nSince this is a long-term illness, it is vital that you consider the prevention tips to improve and prolong the quality of life of your dog.\n\nKeep your dog slim\n\nIt is important that your dog maintains an ideal BCS of 4-5 to prevent

suggest:\n\nMind/puzzle games to keep them busy\nKeeping your dog on the lead\nShort walks, on average a 10 minutes walk 3-4 times a day\nCold therapy during painful episodes\n\nApplying cold to the hips after a flare-up of lameness can reduce inflammation and pain in a natural way.\n\nFor most dogs, applying a cold pack to the hips for 10 minutes, especially after exercise, can be helpful.\n\nWe still recommend you contact a vet before applying cold therapy to your dog.¬†\n\nAdapting activity levels for long-term management\n\nIn the long term, dogs may benefit from short and frequent walks, and you will learn what they can cope with.¬†\n\nThe following guidelines are encouraged:\n\nAvoid vigorous off-lead exercise, which will put excessive stress on their hips.\nShort, frequent walks are better than long, infrequent walks.\nExercise patterns should be regular: avoid short walks during the week and long walks during the weekend.\nConsider avoiding or reducing time spent ball/stick chasing in the park and/or boisterous play with other dogs.\nHigh-impact activities such as running, jumping, twisting, and turning would be expected to cause lameness, so these activities may need to be avoided or reduced even in the long term.\nLiving with a dog with hip dysplasia:\nCost of surgery for dogs with hip dysplasia\n\nTreatments for hip dysplasia can become expensive.¬†\n\nIf your dog has pet insurance, it‚Äôs worth chatting with your insurance provider to understand if they can provide support for any treatment required.\n\nSurgery can eliminate pain that sometimes even life-long

It‚Äôs a common cause of illness in middle-aged to older cats. Around 1 in 10 cats of any breed or sex will develop hyperthyroidism. If the condition is effectively managed, they can go on to enjoy a good quality of life for years.¬†\n\nHyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid glands become overactive. The most common cause is a harmless growth of one or both thyroid glands. Early warning signs include weight loss, despite eating well and changes in behaviour. There are multiple treatment options available. In over 95% of cases, hyperthyroidism can be treated medically or even cured. So the outlook is good for most treated cats.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is hyperthyroidism in cats?\n\nHyperthyroidism means there‚Äôs too much of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine, in your cat‚Äôs system. Thyroxine controls metabolic rate or how quickly the body burns up energy.\n\nYour cat has 2 small thyroid glands in their neck. Over 95% of hyperthyroidism cases result from a growth on a thyroid gland. This growth is usually benign, meaning it doesn‚Äôt spread to other parts of the body. But it produces extra thyroid hormone. And thyroid hormone has profound effects on your cat‚Äôs metabolism. Think of metabolism as a car‚Äôs acceleration. Hyperthyroidism is like having the accelerator pedal pressed down and stuck to the floor! Everything ‚Äòspeeds up‚Äô uncontrollably and the engine burns through much more fuel (food and oxygen). Eventually, various ‚Äòengine components‚Äô (organs) will become damaged and stop working. And the ‚Äòengine‚Äô starts to fail. Inside your cat‚Äôs body, this means:\n\nIncreasing nutritional (food) requirements to fuel increased metabolism\nIncreasing heart rate and thickening heart muscle\nIncreasing blood pressure\nDamage to kidneys and intestine\n\nHyperthyroidism is a serious illness, but a range of options exist for management and treatment.\n\nAround 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism result from cancer of the thyroid gland. Outlook is more uncertain for this group, although treatment options are available.\n\n\n¬†\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?\n\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism relate to increased metabolism, including the increased demand for fuel and the damage to vital organs.\n\nLosing weight despite eating more\nVomiting and diarrhoea\nDrinking more and peeing more\nBecoming hyperactive, restless and/or more vocal\nDeveloping a dull, staring coat\nIncreasing heart rate\nBreathing difficulties\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of hyperthyroidism?\n\nCats over 10 years old are most likely to develop hyperthyroidism.\n\nAll breeds and sexes are equally at risk.\n\n¬†\n\nAre my family or other pets at risk of hyperthyroidism\n\nHyperthyroidism affects individual cats. Your family and other pets are not at risk of getting hyperthyroidism.¬†\n\nHowever, medicine that suppresses your cat‚Äôs thyroid hormone levels can have the same effect on humans.\n\nMedicine for hyperthyroidism must be handled carefully, especially by women of childbearing age\nWash your hands carefully after handling tablets\nClean surfaces thoroughly after any contact\nKeep all medicines out of sight and reach of children and pets.¬†\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose hyperthyroidism\n\nVets diagnose hyperthyroidism based on the following:\n\nThe ‚Äòhistory‚Äô: any changes you report, eg losing weight, hyperactivity, vomiting etc\nPhysical examination: sometimes vets can feel an enlarged thyroid gland in your cat‚Äôs neck. This is called a goitre.\nBlood tests: general check and thyroid hormone level\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for hyperthyroidism?\n\nFour treatment options are available:\n\nAnti-thyroid medicines\nAnti-thyroid diet\nSurgery\nRadioactive iodine injection\n\nThe choice for your cat depends on the severity of their symptoms and the practical considerations.\n\nPracticalities include:\n\nWill your cat take medicine?\n\nWill your cat take tablets?\nDoes your lifestyle permit giving your cat medicine regularly?\nDoes your cat have other health conditions, likely to be complicated by more medicines, anaesthetics or hospital stays?\nDoes your cat go outdoors or hunt and do you have more than one cat?\n\nWhere you live¬†\n\nAre you close to a clinic that offers surgery or radioactive iodine treatment?\nIf not, does your cat travel well?\nDo you have transport?\n\nCost of treatment¬†\n\nCosts will vary depending on the options, the area you live and where you buy medication or special diets.\n\nVariable costs for complications include:\n\nSide effects like vomiting and diarrhoea\nAnaesthetic reactions or post-surgery complications, including wound infections, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism (low blood calcium), repeat surgery for a second or subsequent growth\nHospital stays for longer than quoted\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a cat with hyperthyroidism at home\n\nThere are no home remedies for cats with hyperthyroidism. But home support is essential to ensure your cat gets the most benefit from their vet treatment.\n\nGive thyroid medicine as prescribed at the correct dose and time\nMake sure your cat¬† takes their medication (no spitting it out behind the sofa!)\nAsk for help or alternatives if you are struggling to give tablets\nCheck your cat‚Äôs weight regularly. Weight loss can be the first warning sign that treatment needs reviewed\nTake your cat for regular vet checks and keep on top of preventive care, like worming and vaccinations\nUnless your cat is on Y/D prescription food, feed a diet which provides lots of calories (energy), enough fat and high-quality protein such as chicken, rabbit or fish\n\n¬†\n\nCan hyperthyroidism be prevented?\n\nHyperthyroidism can‚Äôt be prevented. But it can be controlled for long periods. It can even be cured with radioactive Iodine treatment\n\nIt‚Äôs not always easy to notice gradual changes in your cat‚Äôs weight and body condition when you see them every day.\n\nWeigh your cat¬† regularly as they get older; every 1-3 months\nWeight Loss is an excellent early warning for ill health in cats\nSeek vet advice promptly if you do notice changes in your cat‚Äôs eating or drinking habits or behaviour\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about cats with hyperthyroidism\n\nSevere or untreated hyperthyroidism leads to organ failure and death. Vital organs such as the liver and kidneys are susceptible. But high blood pressure can also damage the eyes and brain.\n\nWarning signs of worsening thyroid illness include:\n\nPersistent vomiting or diarrhoea\nWeakness and collapse\nBreathing difficulties- fast shallow breathing, open-mouthed breathing\nLethargy (tiredness)\nGoing suddenly blind\nConfusion, pacing, head-pressing\nFits or seizures\n\nCall your nearest vet if your cat is having seizures or suddenly seems blind\n\nThyroid treatment and kidney disease\n\nUntreated hyperthyroidism will cause kidney damage.\n\nBut older cats are also at higher risk of kidney disease for other reasons.¬†And symptoms of kidney disease may only start to show up after your cat starts antithyroid treatment. This happens because of the following:\n\nHyperthyroidism causes increased blood pressure\nHigher blood pressure in untreated cats pushes blood into the kidneys\nAs blood pressure falls in treated cats, the kidneys have less effective blood flow.\nKidney impairment which was compensated by better blood flow may rapidly worsen\nWorsening kidney function complicates longer-term recovery and may make some treatments unsuitable.\n\nAssess quality of life\n\n¬†\n\nJoii can help with:\nRecognising symptoms of hyperthyroidism\nChoosing and keeping to the right diet for your cat\nGiving medication\nChoosing the treatment option best for you and your cat\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This is a common problem for very senior cats.\n\n¬†\n\nThere are many possible causes for bowel incontinence. Some cats pass stools without knowing and others have some awareness but things no longer flow properly. In older cats there can be a combination of problems and an association with dementia. In younger cats, incontinence is usually due to injury or nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is incontinent\n\nIf your cat becomes incontinent suddenly, speak to a vet right away. This is especially important if they are also showing signs of pain or having trouble moving. They may have suffered nerve or spinal damage.\n\nIf the problem is intermittent or has developed slowly over time, a vet check is still important to rule out serious disease.\n\nCheck your pet frequently and remove any soiling as soon as possible to avoid skin problems and secondary infections.\n\n¬†\n\nCommon causes of bowel incontinence in cats\n\nIf the anus loses its strength, poo will come out without the cat realising it.\n\nCats may also attempt to pass stools but the process may be difficult or abnormal, with faeces sometimes coming out after they leave the tray.\n\nSome common causes are:\n\nTail pull injury: the nerves at the end of the spine are stretched and lose function. This may be temporary or permanent.\nTraumatic spinal injury: damage to the spine from an accident or attack.\nSphincter incontinence: the muscles and nerves keeping the anus closed stop working properly.\nCognitive dysfunction or Dementia: the brain is no longer monitoring or controlling the passage of poo.\nTumour\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about bowel incontinence in cats\n\nSudden incontinence is usually due to a serious injury or disease.

It is important to check if there is a hidden cause.\nMake litter tray access easier, by providing more trays around the house or choosing ones that are easier to get into.\nChange diet to reduce the amount of poo produced while still keeping the right amounts of all nutrients.\nIf associated with dementia, treatments for this may help.\nCheck their skin and coat for soiling frequently. Keeping them clean is important to avoid complications.\nKeep bedding clean and dry.\n\nBowel incontinence is often associated with other problems that seriously impact the quality of life. If you are struggling to manage this problem or it is causing important complications, euthanasia may be the kindest option.

There are many different problems that may cause your cat to itch.¬†\n\nSome conditions are more common in different breeds or at different ages. Depending on the cause and condition, cats may need lifelong treatment. If your cat becomes itchy, consult a vet for advice as soon as possible. If left untreated, itching can worsen and lead to severe self-trauma, hair loss, and skin infections.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is itchy\n\nDepending on how severe the signs are, different treatment options may be available.\n\nMild itching is when the itch does not happen often. This can often be treated at home, depending on the cause. Skin supplements, diet changes, parasite control, and topical skin treatments can all be useful. Speak to our Joii vets for more information.\nWhen your cat is constantly scratching, we describe this as moderate or severe itching. They will stop what they are doing, such as eating or sleeping, to itch themselves. This often requires prescription medication to resolve the symptoms. Contact your local veterinarian for an appointment as soon as possible.\n\nThe most common causes of itching in cats\n\nThere are many different things that can cause your cat to itch. Click on the links to explore each cause in more detail.\n\nAllergies\n\nAllergies are the most common cause of itching in cats and can be split into different categories\n\nFlea allergy dermatitis: an infection of the skin caused by flea bites.\nFood allergies: an allergy to something in the food. Usually the protein source, such as chicken or beef.\nA contact allergic reaction: sudden in appearance and often seen as bumps all over the skin, usually starting around the face. Also known as urticaria, or hives.\nFeline atopic skin syndrome: a type of skin allergy usually caused by environmental allergies such as pollen, dust mites, or smoke.\nParasites\nFleas: are the most common cause of itching in cats. Indoor cats can get fleas too.\nMites: Demodex and Sarcoptes (mange), ear mites, harvest mites\nSkin infections\n\nThese are often secondary to allergies or parasites.\n\nBacterial, yeast, or fungal\nEar disease: most often related to allergies. Can also be due to foreign bodies, ear mites, or masses in the ear.\nRingworm\nOthers\nPain: often when it involves a specific area. Can cause cats to chew or bite at an area of skin. Includes acute pain, such as wounds, and long-term pain, such as arthritis.\nWounds¬†or injuries: such as cat bite abscesses.\nStress: a common cause of overgrooming, often caused by a change in your cat‚Äôs environment or routine.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about your itchy cat\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour cat is constantly itching throughout the day.\nYour cat develops any severe skin lesions, or they are widespread over the body.\nYour cat is unwell as well as itchy.\nYour cat has a sudden allergic reaction with breathing problems.\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYour cat has a mild itch or has started scratching their ears.\nYour cat has small or localised skin issues.\nYou have questions about what skin supplements or ear cleaners are best to use.\nYou have questions about the best parasite control for cats.\nYou have any questions about food allergies or how to do diet trials.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent your cat from itching\nUse regular parasite control that covers fleas, mites, ticks, and worms.\nRegularly clean your cat‚Äôs bedding, collar, and bowls.\nDust and vacuum the house often, and avoid sprays or perfumes in the house.\nBrush your cat regularly and check for any abnormal areas of skin.\nFeed your cat high-quality, complete food for their age and lifestyle. Some brands also have a special skincare line with high omega oil levels.\nSkin supplements containing omega oils for cats with skin diseases.\nDust mite spray for the house is useful for cats with those allergies.\nGet your cat checked out by a vet as soon as possible if they become itchy to help prevent self-trauma to the skin.\nAvoid any sudden changes in your cat‚Äôs routine and environment.\nMake sure your cat has all the key resources they need for a happy and healthy life. Our¬†Stress in cats article has more information about this.\n\nOur Joii team are available 24 hours a day for advice, call us now if you have any questions.\n\nHow to know if your cat is itchy\n\nThe medical term for itching is pruritus. It may not always be obvious that your cat is itchy. Some cats will secretly scratch or show other signs of being itchy, such as chewing, biting, rubbing, and licking.\n\nYou may notice skin lesions, such as:\n\nHair loss or bald patches, usually caused by overgrooming\nPink or red skin\nDark or thickened skin\nScabs, dry skin, a rash, hives, blisters, or black spots\nBleeding skin from self-trauma\nGreasy skin, dandruff and flakes\nLumps and swellings\nCat with hair loss and rash\n\nThe eosinophilic reaction has three characteristic signs, including:\n\nSwollen lip or chin\nA plaque: red, thickened, painful and itchy area of skin that is common on the thighs, face and neck\nA granuloma: a weepy and swollen area of skin that is common on the thigh, paws and in the mouth\nA swollen lip can be a sign of allergies in cats\n\nDifferent body parts may be affected, such as:\n\nEars: itchy, red, discharge (including wax), smelly, swollen, shaking head\nEyes: itchy, weepy, red, holding them closed\nRunny nose and sneezing\nStress can cause both physical and behavioural symptoms, such as urinating abnormally, lethargy, a scruffy or matted coat, and weight loss.\nCat with red and waxy ears\n\nYour cat may show other signs too, such as Vomiting, Diarrhoea, weight loss, Pain, or lethargy. Speak to a vet as soon as possible if they are ill as well as itchy.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat an itchy cat at home\n\nIt‚Äôs always best to seek the advice of a vet if your cat shows signs of being itchy. Home remedies may be helpful for certain conditions, and your vet can guide you on the best ones to look for.\n\nAllergies, in particular, can be tricky to treat, and it‚Äôs recommended to take a multi-modal approach. This means using different products and making changes at home to improve the signs.\n\nUse a buster collar, inflatable collar, or medical pet suit to prevent further self-trauma.\nCalming or medicated shampoos, mousses, wipes, or gels are useful for certain conditions, such as skin infections. These are often antibacterial and also soothe the skin.\nSome ear cleaners can also help with mild irritations or infections.\nSpeak to a vet before using any of these home remedies, such as olive oil, apple cider vinegar, or coconut oil. These have limited research in cats and may be more harmful for certain conditions.\nMake sure your cat is up to date with parasite control, especially fleas.\nAllergies\nFor mild itching, skin supplements containing omega oils can help protect the skin barrier.\nA diet trial with a novel or hydrolysed protein is useful to check for food allergies. A novel protein is one that your cat has never eaten before. A strict trial should last 6-8 weeks before assessing the results; cut out all other food and treats.\nMake sure all pets in the household are up to date on parasite control that covers at least fleas and mites.\nIf certain allergies are diagnosed: avoidance of these will help reduce the symptoms.\nStress\nCalming supplements and pheromone adapters, along with advice from a vet.\nHelp from a certified behaviourist is often advised.\nOther causes\n\nFollow the links to see at home treatment for the following:\n\nParasites\n\nFleas\nMange\nEar mites\n\nRingworm\n\nAnal Gland Disease\n\nWounds\n\nPain\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for itchy cats\n\nIf the symptoms are severe, your cat will most likely need prescription medication from your local vet. Usually includes a full physical examination to assess the skin, ears, and all other body parts and determine if any further tests are needed.\n\nPrescription medications include:\n\nAnti-itch medications: there are many different types of these, and your vet will work with you to find the best solution for your cat. Includes steroids and Atopica.\nImmunotherapy: A medication made specifically for each patient based on the results of skin or blood tests for allergies. Helps to desensitise the body to different allergens. It works to reduce the severity of the symptoms of allergies and is usually given by injection every 2-4 weeks.\nAnti-inflammatories: NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication). Often used to treat pain, wounds, and anal gland disease.\nAntihistamines\nParasite treatments\nAntibiotics: come in many different forms, such as shampoo, cream, tablets, liquid, or injection\nAntifungals\nAnxiety medication for cats with underlying behaviour concerns\n\nYour cat may need tests to diagnose certain conditions:\n\nSkin scrapes, hair plucks, or biopsy\nEar or anal gland flush and swab\nBlood and urine tests\nIntradermal skin testing if allergies are suspected\nA strict food trial to check for allergies in the food\nImaging, including x-rays, usually done if pain is suspected\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of becoming itchy?\nStress\nRescue cats and those living in a multi-cat household can be more at risk of stress\nEar disease is often associated with an underlying allergy.\nFleas\nCan affect any cat but they are more common in those that spend time outdoors\nAllergies\nThere is no known link between breeds, age, or gender.\nCat bite abscess\nMore common in male outdoor cats\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of itching in cats\n\nAnal gland disease\n\nNutrient deficiencies\n\nOsteoarthritis\n\nConjunctivitis\n\nTicks: don‚Äôt tend to be itchy but can cause skin reactions.\n\nLice: not common in cats.

Includes acute pain, such as wounds, and long-term pain, such as arthritis.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about your itchy dog\n\nSeek help from a vet if\n\nYour dog is constantly itching throughout the day.\nYour dog develops any severe skin lesions, or they are widespread over the body.\nYour dog is unwell as well as itchy.\nYour dog has a sudden allergic reaction with breathing problems.\n\nJoii can help if\n\nYour dog has a mild itch or has started scratching their ears.\nYour dog has small or localised skin issues.\nYou have questions about what skin supplements or ear cleaners are best to use.\nYou have questions about the best parasite control for dogs.\nYou have any questions about food allergies or how to do a diet trial.\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent your dog from itching\nUse regular parasite control that covers fleas, mites, ticks, and worms.\nRegularly clean your dog‚Äôs bedding, collar, and bowls.\nDust and vacuum the house often, and avoid sprays or perfumes in the house.\nBrush your dog and check for any abnormal areas of skin at least once a week.\nFeed your dog high-quality, complete food for their age and lifestyle. Some brands also have a special skin care range with high omega oil levels.\nSkin supplements containing omega oils are useful for dogs with skin diseases.\nDust mite spray for the house is useful for dogs with these allergies.\nSome dogs benefit from regular bathing, shampooing, and ear cleaning. Follow professional advice for this, as bathing too often can also cause problems.\nGet your dog checked over with a vet as soon as possible if they become itchy to help prevent self-trauma to the skin.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to know if your dog is itchy\n\nThe medical term for itching is pruritus. It may not always be obvious that your dog is itchy. Some dogs will secretly scratch or show other signs of being itchy, such as chewing, biting, rubbing, and licking.\n\nYou may notice skin lesions, such as:\n\nHair loss or bald patches\nPink or red skin\nDark or thickened skin\nScabs, dry skin, a rash, hives, blisters, or black spots\nBleeding skin from self-trauma\nSaliva staining on the paws\nDandruff and flakes\nLumps and swellings\nHair loss is a common symptom\n\n¬†\n\nSaliva staining makes the paws look red or brown\n\nDifferent body parts may be affected, such as\n\nEars: itchy, red, discharge (including wax), smelly, swollen, shaking head\nEyes: itchy, weepy, red, holding them closed\nRunny nose and¬†Sneezing\nPaws/feet: itchy, swelling, lumps, red skin\nTail and bum: itchy skin, scooting, swelling, lumps\nDog with red inflamed ears\n\nYour dog may show other signs, such as Vomiting, Diarrhoea, weight loss, Pain, or lethargy. Speak to a vet as soon as possible if they are ill as well as being itchy. Our Joii team are available 24 hours a day for advice.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat an itchy dog at home\n\nIt‚Äôs always best to seek the advice of a vet if your dog shows signs of being itchy. Home remedies may be helpful for certain conditions, and your vet can guide you on the best ones to look for. Our Joii vets are available 24 hours a day for any questions.\n\nAllergies, in particular, can be tricky to treat, and it‚Äôs recommended to take a multi-modal approach. This means using different products and methods to improve the signs.\n\nUse a buster collar, inflatable collar, or medical pet suit to prevent further self-trauma.\nCalming or medicated shampoos, mousses, wipes, and gels are useful for certain conditions, including mild skin infections. These are often antibacterial and also soothe the skin.\nSome ear cleaners can also help with mild irritations or infections.\nSpeak to a vet before using any of these home remedies, such as olive oil, apple cider vinegar, or coconut oil. These have limited research in dogs and may be more harmful for some conditions.\nMake sure your dog is up to date on parasite control.\nFeed a good quality, complete diet. Hill‚Äôs food, Derm Complete, is useful for a range of conditions that can cause your dog to be itchy. It is proven to help with both food and environmental allergies.\nAllergies\nFor mild itching, skin supplements containing omega oils can help protect the skin barrier.\nA diet trial with a novel or hydrolysed protein to check for food allergies. A novel protein is one that your dog has never eaten before. A strict trial lasting 6-8 weeks before assessing the results; cut out all other food and treats.\nMake sure all pets in the household are up to date on parasite control that covers at least fleas and mites.\nIf your dog has specific allergies, try to avoid contact with them. For example, avoid walking when the pollen count is high, avoid long grass, dust regularly, and feed certain foods.\nOther causes\n\nFollow the links to see at home treatment for the following:\n\nParasites\n\nFleas\nMange\nEar mites\n\nRingworm\n\nAnal Gland Disease\n\nPain\n\nWounds\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for itchy dogs\n\nYour dog might need prescription medication from your local vet. This usually involves a full physical examination to assess the skin, ears, and all other body parts.\n\nPrescription medications include:\n\nAnti-itch medications: there are many different types of these, and your vet will work with you to find the best solution for your dog. Includes steroids, Apoquel, Atopica and Cytopoint.\nAllergen-specific Immunotherapy: A medication made specifically for each patient based on the results of skin or blood tests for allergies. Helps to desensitise the body to different allergens. It works to reduce the severity of the symptoms of allergies and is usually given by injection every 2-4 weeks.\nAnti-inflammatories: NSAIDs (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications). Often used for anal gland disease and treatment of pain.\nAntihistamines: such as Clorphenamine or Loratadine\nParasite treatments: for fleas and different types of mites\nAntibiotics: many different forms, such as tablets, liquids, injections, creams, or shampoo\nAntifungal medication\n\nOther tests to diagnose certain conditions:\n\nSkin scrapes, hair plucks, or biopsy\nEar or anal gland flush and swab\nBlood and urine tests\nIntradermal skin testing for allergies\nA strict food trial to check for allergies in the food\nImaging, including x-rays, usually done if pain is suspected\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of becoming itchy?\nAllergies\n\nAtopy/environmental\n\nBreeds: English and French Bulldogs, Bull Terriers, Labrador Retrievers, Spaniels, Poodles, West Highland White Terriers, and Shar Peis.\nAges: usually begin in young adults\n\nFood allergies\n\nCan occur at any age but are more common when less than 1 year old.\nSome breeds may be more at risk, including West Highland White Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, and Irish Terriers.\nEar disease\nBreeds: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, Retrievers, Poodles, Pugs, and French Bulldogs.\nDogs that like to swim can be at higher risk of ear infections.\nEar disease is often associated with an underlying allergy.\nAnal gland disease\nBreeds: All dogs can develop anal gland problems, but they are more common in small breeds such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Cocker Spaniels, Bichon Frises, and Shih Tzus.\nAn inadequate diet, soft stools, obesity, and allergies can also lead to anal gland disease.\nMange\nDogs with weaker immune systems are more at risk.

Most often it is due to spinal or tail injuries.\n\nIncontinence is when urine is passed without control.¬† Controlling the passage of urine requires a combination of voluntary actions and involuntary reflexes. Voluntary control can be affected by serious damage to any part of the spine. Reflexes can be affected by damage to nerves near the base of the tail. If the bladder is very distended it can lead to overflow and leakage. All of these problems are very serious and a vet check is urgently needed.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is leaking urine\n\nSee a vet straight away if:\n\nan adult cat is leaking urine\nthey appear to be in pain or are not acting normal.\n\nHandle them gently and carefully, as they may be injured.

It is more common in middle-aged neutered females and usually responds well to treatment. Puppies can have a rare and more serious type of incontinence.\n\nThe most common cause is urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence, where the urethra becomes too weak to stop urine from dripping out of the bladder. In puppies, incontinence is often due to a birth defect called ectopic ureter. Urinary incontinence can also be caused by spinal disease or other nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence in dogs\nWhy is my dog leaking urine?\n\nUrinary incontinence is when urine leaks out without the dog realising it. This usually happens when they are lying down or resting.\n\nIn puppies with ectopic ureter, the urine coming from the kidneys is deposited beyond the bladder, which prevents normal storage and control.\n\nIn adult dogs the muscles controlling the exit to the bladder weaken over time and the position of the bladder may change.\n\nIn neutered animals, hormonal changes play a significant role in the development of incontinence.\n\nIncontinence from spinal or nerve problems usually happens together with other symptoms, such as pain and trouble moving.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence in dogs¬†\n\nSpots or puddles of urine on their bed or where they rest\n\nArea around vulva or penis may be wet\n\nPuppies may dribble urine when standing and moving¬†\n\nSymptoms in puppies may not start until they are fully grown\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of urinary incontinence than others?\n\nThe majority of dogs affected by this condition are neutered females\n\nLarge breeds are more commonly affected, particularly Irish Setters and Boxers\n\nIn puppies, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more commonly affected\n\n¬†\n\nHow is urinary incontinence diagnosed in dogs?\n\nEctopic ureters in puppies can be difficult to diagnose. If size permits, cystoscopy may be ideal. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed through the urethra so the inside can be checked.\n\nOther options include an ultrasound scan, a special type of x-ray or a CT scan.\n\nIn adult dogs, urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence is usually diagnosed by ruling out other causes of incontinence.\n\nA urine test is recommended in all cases to rule out infection and disease in other organs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for urinary incontinence in dogs?\n\nIn puppies, the abnormal urine path must be closed. In many cases, this can be done during cystoscopy. If not, surgery is required.\n\nIn adult dogs, there are medications to improve bladder control. These tend to work well in females but not so much in males.\n\nSome medications, like phenylpropanolamine (Propalin), directly improve the strength of the muscles around the bladder exit.\n\nOther medications, like estriol (Incurin), replace the effects of oestrogen on the urethral muscle.\n\nThese two types of medications can be used together, and this is thought to have additional benefits.\n\nIf not responding to medication, there are surgical procedures that will reduce urine losses by re-positioning the bladder slightly (colposuspension).\n\nIt is also possible to insert an artificial urethral sphincter to control urine flow or inject material into the urethral wall to increase tension.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with urinary incontinence\n\nUrine can be very irritant to the skin. Until the urine leakage is resolved, it is important to prevent prolonged contact between urine and skin. Simply wiping away any wetness should be enough in most cases.¬†\n\nFor small leaks, incontinence pads or nappies may help manage the problem in the short term. These need to be changed frequently. Look out for any irritation of the skin or vulva and stop using if this develops.\n\nIncreasing the frequency of walks may help, as a fuller bladder is more likely to leak.\n\nFrequent washing of bedding will reduce contamination.\n\nApplying a barrier ointment, like vaseline, to the skin around the vulva or penis may help prevent urine scald.\n\nNever limit water intake as this could cause serious problems!\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent incontinence in dogs\n\nThere is an association between neutering and incontinence in female dogs.¬†\n\nAn association has also been found with excess body weight.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about your dog with incontinence\n\nCall your vet straight away if your dog is urinating more, straining, or having accidents in the house as there may be a more serious problem.¬†\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYou‚Äôd like to discuss the ideal age for neutering your dog\nYou want to talk about weight control\nYou want to get feeding and diet tips\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Cats of any age, breed, or sex can be affected. Acute kidney failure usually develops within a matter of days and symptoms become very serious very quickly.\n\nAcute kidney failure (injury) happens when the kidneys suffer damage and stop working. This leads to a build-up of fluid and toxic waste inside the body. Acute kidney failure can sometimes¬†be reversed¬†with rapid and intensive vet care. But it‚Äôs a life-threatening illness and around 50% of cats who develop acute kidney failure won‚Äôt survive. Cats who do recover may develop long-term health problems, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). The sooner acute kidney failure¬†is recognised¬†and treated, the better the chances of long-term recovery.\n\nWhat is acute kidney failure in cats?\n\nThe kidneys are two essential organs in your cat‚Äôs abdomen. Their functions include:\n\nControlling fluid and salt levels in the body\nRemoving toxins and waste from the blood\nProducing some hormones.\n\nWhen the kidneys stop working, the body can‚Äôt control fluid and salt levels. All the organs and tissues which depend on this control also stop working. This includes the heart, muscles and brain. The damage gets worse as harmful waste products continue to accumulate.\n\n¬†\n\nCauses of Acute Kidney Failure\n\n¬†\n\nPoisons\nChemicals- antifreeze, cleaning products, batteries, insecticides, paint\nPlants- lilies, bulbs\nSome Foods- raisins, chocolate\nAnti-parasite treatments\nCertain medicines ‚Äì some¬†painkillers, antibiotics and antifungal drugs\n\n¬†\n\nInfection\nViral infections (FIP, FeLV, FIV)\nSevere or recurrent kidney infections (pyelonephritis)\nParasite infections- toxoplasmosis\n\n¬†\n\nReduced blood flow\n\nIt deprives the kidneys of vital oxygen from red blood cells\n\nTrauma (road accidents)\nShock (sepsis, organ failure)\nHeart failure (cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure)\nSevere dehydration\n\n¬†\n\nBack pressure\n\nDamage to kidney tissue when urine can‚Äôt flow from the kidneys to the bladder and out of the body\n\nBlocked bladder.\nCrystals or stones blocking the kidneys or the ureters\n\nKidneys produce urine, which passes to the bladder through small tubes called ureters. Urine leaves the bladder (and the body) through another wider tube, called the urethra. If urine can‚Äôt escape out of the bladder, fluid builds up inside the kidneys, making them swell. This causes buildup of pressure inside the kidneys. If not treated early, the resulting damage to kidney structure can lead to kidney failure.\n\n¬†\n\nCancer\n\nIt may begin in the kidneys themselves or spread there from other parts of the body.\n\nSymptoms of acute kidney failure in cats\n\nSymptoms of acute kidney failure in cats will often overlap those of other serious illnesses.\n\nNot eating\nVomiting and diarrhoea, possibly with blood\nLethargy and weakness\nSevere halitosis (bad breath)\nMouth ulcers and drooling saliva\nGoing blind suddenly\nCollapse and seizures\n\nFind your nearest vet if your cat is collapsed, having seizures, or has been vomiting blood.\n\nCats at higher risk of developing acute kidney failure\n\nSome cats will have more risk of developing acute kidney failure, depending on their lifestyle and general health.\n\n¬†\n\nOutdoor cats\n\nThey are more likely to encounter antifreeze (ethylene glycol), and poisonous plants in gardens.\n\n¬†\n\nOlder cats\n\nOlder cats are more likely to have other illnesses and age-related changes which predispose them to acute kidney failure. They may already suffer from chronic kidney disease.\n\n¬†\n\nCats with other illnesses\n\nIllnesses which affect the blood supply and health of the kidneys. For example:\n\nChronic kidney disease\nOveractive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\nPancreatitis\nHeart disease\nCats with urinary tract disease (FLUTD), especially overweight indoor male cats\nKidney and bladder stones (urolithiasis)\n\n¬†\n\nCertain breeds\n\nBreeds can have inherited problems that weaken their kidneys. This makes them prone to chronic kidney disease and then acute kidney disease. This is known as acute-on-chronic kidney disease.\n\nPersian-¬†¬†(polycystic kidney disease, PKD)\nSiamese and Abyssinian-¬†(renal amyloidosis)\n\nCats receiving certain medication.¬†All medicines can have side effects. Some can damage your cat‚Äôs kidneys. This may happen even without taking more than the recommended dose\n\nPainkillers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nCertain antibiotics\nAntifungal treatments\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching acute kidney failure?\n\nAcute kidney failure is not in itself a risk to humans or to other pets.\n\nViruses which cause kidney disease may spread between cats who live together. For example:\n\nFIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis)\nFelv (Feline Leukaemia Virus)\nFiv (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of acute kidney failure in cats\n\nVets diagnose acute kidney failure from the following checks and tests:\n\nSymptoms\nHistory\nBlood tests to check for levels of important proteins, chemicals and electrolytes (salts) in the blood\nUrine test ‚Äì analysis and bacterial culture\nBlood pressure check\nUltrasound Scan\nX-rays\n\nVet treatment for acute kidney failure\n\nAcute kidney failure is a life-threatening condition that needs intensive care at a vet clinic or hospital.\n\n¬†\n\nIntensive vet care\nFluids directly into your cat‚Äôs veins to flush the kidneys\nPain relief and Antibiotics to control infection\nRebalancing electrolytes (salts) in the body\nProtecting stomach and intestines from acid and toxin damage (gastrointestinal protectants)\nControlling blood pressure\nMedicine to start the kidneys making urine again\nTreating the underlying cause of the kidney failure if possible\nReplacing essential vitamins\n\n¬†\n\nSpecialist treatments\nKidney dialysis ‚Äì aims to keep cats with acute kidney failure stable while the kidneys recover. It‚Äôs a specialist treatment carried out in special veterinary hospitals. It‚Äôs only appropriate if the underlying cause has been found and is curable.\nKidney transplants?¬† Kidney transplants for cats happen in some countries. There are welfare and ethical concerns for both the donor cat and the sick cat. Kidney Transplants are banned in the UK. A kidney transplant wouldn‚Äôt help a cat with acute kidney failure. The disease develops suddenly and there‚Äôs widespread damage to other organs.\n\nHow to look after a cat with acute kidney disease at home\n\nThere are no home remedies. Acute kidney failure needs intensive treatment at a vet clinic.\n\nCats who recover need ongoing care at home and regular check-ups with a vet.\n\nKeep your cat indoors during recovery\nGive prescribed medicines at the right time and dose\nEncourage your cat to drink lots ‚Äì provide a water fountain and add water to food\nFeed your cat a special¬†prescription diet¬†recommended for kidney disease\nEncourage your cat to eat ‚Äì warm up food or add in salt-free stock\nGive recommended vitamin supplements\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with acute kidney failure\n\nCats who survive the early stages of acute kidney failure need ongoing treatment at home.

Kidney disease may be acute (sudden) or chronic (gradual).\n\nAcute kidney failure (acute kidney injury) is a life-threatening illness. It can affect dogs of any age, breed or sex. Around 0.5 to 7% of all dogs will develop some form of kidney disease in their lifetime. Acute kidney failure usually develops within a matter of days and symptoms become very serious very quickly.\n\nAcute kidney failure happens when your dog‚Äôs kidneys suffer damage and stop working.

Kidney disease may be chronic (comes on gradually) or acute (sudden).\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common illnesses affecting cats. Cats of any age, sex or breed may develop chronic kidney disease, but it‚Äôs most common in older cats. Around 30% of all cats over 10 years old (of any breed) have chronic kidney disease, rising to 50% of cats over 15 years old. Younger cats who get chronic kidney disease are more likely to belong to certain breeds, including Maine Coon, Ragdoll and Siamese.\n\nKidneys carry out essential functions in the body. As cats get older, their kidneys become less efficient. The reason why this happens isn‚Äôt known. There are triggers which can make it happen earlier or progress quicker. These include toxins, infections and other illnesses. There‚Äôs no cure for Chronic Kidney Disease.¬†Eventually, the kidneys will fail completely. But the rate of deterioration varies between cats. Symptoms of CKD can often¬†be stabilised¬†for prolonged periods. Early diagnosis and treatment help achieve the best outcome for the longest time.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease in cats?¬†\n\nChronic kidney disease means your cat‚Äôs kidneys have suffered damage over a long time. The damage can‚Äôt be reversed or cured.\n\nWe often don‚Äôt know how the kidneys get damaged. Ageing change is part of the cause, but other factors can include:\n\nExposure to toxins; anti-freeze, grapes, raisins, some antibiotics\nSevere or recurrent kidney infections (pyelonephritis)\nCertain immune-mediated illnesses\nInherited kidney defects in some breeds\n\n¬†\n\nWhy the kidneys matter\n\nThe kidneys are two small organs in your cat‚Äôs tummy.\n\nUrinary tract in cats.They carry out a number of essential functions, including:\n\nControlling fluid and salt levels in the body\nRemoving toxins and waste from the blood\nProducing some hormones.\n\nWhen the kidneys stop working properly, the body can‚Äôt control fluid and salt levels. All the organs and tissues which depend on this control also start to struggle. This includes the heart, muscles and brain. The damage gets worse as harmful waste products continue to accumulate.\n\nSymptoms of chronic kidney disease in cats\n\nThe symptoms of kidney disease result from losing control of fluid balance in the body and from build-up of waste products.\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\nDrinking and peeing (urinating) more\nLosing weight and eating less\nSleeping more\nVomiting¬†from time to time\nDeveloping a dull staring coat\nDeveloping bad breath and pale gums (anaemia)\n\nChronic kidney disease isn‚Äôt painful in the early stages or when controlled\n\nIn the later stages of chronic kidney disease, your cat may develop¬†high blood pressure¬†(hypertension), This is a dangerous complication of chronic kidney disease. Symptoms include:\n\nHead-pressing and staring into space\nSudden blindness\nSeizures\n\nCall your nearest vet if you think your cat has developed symptoms of high blood pressure.\n\nCats at higher risk of chronic kidney disease\n\nAlthough we don‚Äôt usually know why chronic kidney disease happens, some factors increase your cat‚Äôs risk of developing the condition. For example:\n\nRecurrent kidney infections¬†(pyelonephritis)\n\nInherited abnormalities:\n\nAmyloidosis ‚Äì abnormal proteins build up in the kidneys and stop them working¬†properly. Amyloidosis happens in Siamese and Abyssinian cats but is rare in other breeds.\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD)- fluid-filled cysts may develop in the kidneys. Persian cats (and their related breeds) are susceptible.\n\nIllness elsewhere¬†in the body, such as sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\n¬†\n\nAre humans or other pets at risk?\n\nChronic kidney disease does not spread between cats or from cats to humans.\n\nDiagnosis of chronic kidney disease in cats\n\nCats only develop symptoms of CKD¬† when they‚Äôve lost about 70% of their kidney function. Another way of looking at this is that your cat only needs about half of one kidney to look normal. This means we usually only identify chronic kidney disease in advanced stages\n\nVets diagnose chronic kidney disease based on:\n\nSymptoms¬†\n\nUrine tests:¬†\n\nUrine specific gravity (USG) ‚Äì cats with chronic kidney disease have very dilute (weak) urine\nProtein levels ‚Äì Diseased kidneys leak increasing amounts of protein into the urine\nBacterial Culture ‚Äì Bacterial infection can cause kidney disease or make it worse\n\nBlood tests:\n\n¬†Urea (blood urea nitrogen, BUN) and Creatinine Levels. These raise when kidney function falls by around 60-70%. Both are very useful tests.¬†But¬†things like diet, dehydration and exercise can also influence them.\nSDMA¬†(symmetric dimethylarginine) is a new test. It detects kidney disease early when around 25% of kidney function is lost (rather than 60-70%). This means diagnosing chronic kidney disease one to three years earlier than with BUN and creatinine alone.\nPhosphorus Levels. These increase because diseased kidneys can‚Äôt get rid of excess phosphorus from the body.\n\nX-ray or Ultrasound scan to check the shape, size and structure of the kidneys. These tests can detect kidney stones (uroliths, calculi), which can cause chronic kidney disease or make it worse.\n\nVet treatment for chronic kidney disease\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment for severe or advanced chronic kidney disease\nGiving fluids to treat dehydration caused by losing of too much fluid from the body as weak urine.¬†If your cat is very dehydrated, they may need to have fluids and medicine through a drip into their leg\nStabilising electrolyte (salt) levels in the blood to help nerves and muscles continue to work properly\nControlling of high blood pressure\n\n¬†\n\nOngoing treatment\n\nSpecial diets:¬†prescription diets for kidney disease contain the correct balance of high-quality protein, salt levels, essential fatty acids and appetite stimulants for cats with chronic kidney disease.\n\nMedication:¬†prescription tablets and liquid medicine\n\nAnti-sickness medication to reduce nausea and vomiting\nAppetite stimulants to encourage eating\nMedicine to reduce protein loss in urine and minimise weight loss\nPotassium supplements ‚Äì Essential support for heart and muscle function\nGastric (stomach) protectants ‚Äì To protect the stomach lining\n\nKidney transplants?¬† Although these are carried out in some other countries, kidney transplants in cats are banned in the UK\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stabilise symptoms and quality of life for as long as possible. Chronic kidney disease is harder to control in advanced stages, especially with raised phosphorus levels and high blood pressure. Successful control is also harder in cats with other illnesses.\n\nHome care for your cat with kidney disease\n\nMost cats with chronic kidney disease do very well on home treatment. The following tips will help to keep your cat well for longer and minimise extra trips to the vet.\n\nEnsure your cat has free access to water at all times\nFeed a special prescription diet for kidney disease\nAlways give prescribed medicine and supplements as directed\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with chronic kidney disease\n\nWhen the symptoms are under control, your cat can enjoy a full and happy life.\n\nEncourage your cat to drink as much as possible. Use water fountains and add water to food\nFind a prescription kidney diet your cat likes and keep to it\nWarm food up and add low-salt chicken stock or fish broth to encourage your cat to eat if their appetite is poor\nGive prescription medicines as directed and in a way that doesn‚Äôt stress your cat or you\n\nGetting your cat to eat is more important than persisting with things which won‚Äôt work.\n\nHelping your cat to enjoy good quality of life is the most important goal.\n\n¬†\n\nQuality of life\n\nChronic kidney disease gets progressively worse. Eventually, the symptoms can no longer be controlled. When this happens, it may be kindest to end your cat‚Äôs life peacefully through euthanasia.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to say goodbye\n\nYou may be anxious about how you‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs time to say goodbye.

These infections tend to be mild.\n\nKennel cough can be caused by different viruses and bacteria. It is caught from infected dogs or contaminated objects. Dogs often sound like they have something stuck in their throat. Other common symptoms are a runny nose and sneezing. Most dogs will get better without treatment, but puppies and seniors need close monitoring.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Kennel cough?\n\nRespiratory infection of dogs, can also affect other species\n\nOften requires no treatment other than rest and TLC\n\nRarely dangerous, but very young or senior dogs more vulnerable\n\nVery rarely it can affect immunocompromised people\n\nPlease call us or your local vet if your pet is very lethargic, not eating or breathing seems laboured\n\n¬†\n\nPossible symptoms of Kennel cough\n\nDry, hacking cough, like they have something stuck in their throat\n\nClear discharge from nose\n\nSneezing\n\nReduced appetite\n\nReduced energy levels (lethargy)\n\n¬†\n\nDogs at higher risk of getting Kennel cough\n\nVery young puppies (up to 16 weeks)\n\nSenior dogs, especially those with diseases that affect their immune system\n\nBrachycephalic (flat-nose) breeds (Frenchies, Bulldogs, Pugs)\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of catching Kennel cough?\n\nMost viruses that cause Kennel cough are specific to dogs and will not affect people or other common pets.\n\nThe bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica can spread to other species. Even so, it will be harmless to people unless they are immunocompromised. Guinea pigs are very susceptible to serious illness from this bug, so you will need to isolate them from your pooch if they are coughing.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is Kennel cough diagnosed\n\nMilder cases can be suspected based on examination. If symptoms are more severe, complications are suspected, or symptoms do not improve, chest x-rays are recommended.\n\n¬†\n\nTreatment for Kennel cough\n\nMost cases only need a bit of extra care and support. Please see a few tips below on how you can help your pet recover.\n\nIf the coughing is very intense or uncomfortable, your vet may prescribe an anti-inflammatory.\n\nIf your dog has a fever, congestion in their airways or the lungs become affected, antibiotics and other medications may also be necessary.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog recover from Kennel cough at home\n\nAs their throat will be a little sore, it may be easier for them to eat soft food and smaller meals while they recover. This will also help them stay hydrated.\n\nWater vapour helps clear any congestion in their airways, so exposing them to steam by having them in the room when the shower is being used is often helpful.\n\nResting for a few days will prevent further irritation to their airways and help them recover.\n\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how¬† to prevent Kennel cough\n\nVaccinating your dog will reduce the risk of getting Kennel cough or reduce the symptoms if they still catch it.\n\nIf your dog has Kennel cough, keep them away from other animals at risk of infection for two weeks after the symptoms clear.\n\nDisinfection of objects and surfaces in the room where your dog is staying is necessary, normal household disinfectants work well. Joii can help if you need more tips about this.\n\nIf you need to see your vet, let them know your dog is coughing and discuss with them the best way to organise your visit.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about Kennel Cough\n\nSpeak to a vet in the Joii app or your local practice if your pet:\n\nIs constantly tired or lethargic\n\nIs not eating or drinking much\n\nIs breathing faster or with more effort than usual\n\nHas thick or abundant nasal discharge\n\nIs not getting better after 10-14 days\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Cats are very good at hiding pain or discomfort, make sure to look for more subtle signs of discomfort. If you see your cat limping, keep them indoors until you can speak to a vet.\n\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat starts limping\nCheck your cat\nCan you see any wounds or scabs?\nIs there any bleeding?\nCheck the paws and between the toes.\nCheck the nails.\nCheck for swelling or hot areas on both legs using your two hands at the same time.\nPress along their limping leg and look for any pain or sensitivity.\nCare! The sweetest-natured cat may also try to bite if you find the sore spot. If you are unsure, press the good leg to confirm their response.\nGather information\n\nDid you notice what happened?

Some are more subtle than others.\n\nCheck for other signs of mobility problems:\n\nStiffness or shuffling gait\nDifficulty jumping\nSwelling and heat in the leg\nIncreased grooming on the affected leg\nWounds\nWeakness\nChange in mood or behaviour (e.g. hiding/sleeping in a new spot)\nGrooming less\nPooing or weeing outside the litter tray\nEating less\n\n¬†\n\nHow to diagnose the cause of lameness in cats\n\nTo help determine why your cat is limping, a vet will:\n\nTalk through the history of your cat‚Äôs recent events\nCheck your cat‚Äôs skin\nDo an orthopaedic examination\nTake radiographs (x-rays)\n\nAdditional tests to rule out other conditions might be recommended by your vet:\n\nSwab a wound and send it for culture and sensitivity\nBlood tests\nUrine test\nJoint aspirate and cytology\nOccasionally MRI or a CT scan\n\n¬†\n\nHome remedies for limping cats?\nHuman medication\n\nIbuprofen and paracetamol are highly toxic to cats.\n\nDon‚Äôt give human painkillers to a cat. For pain relief contact a vet.\nWound treatment\n\nIf you see a wound we advise you to:\n\nStop them from causing any further trauma by licking the area using a cone collar, a sock or a body suit.\nBathe the affected area with saline (1 teaspoon of salt in 500ml of cooled boiled water) twice a day.\nContact a vet if no significant improvement is seen after a few days.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat lameness in cats\n\nVet treatment for limping depends on the underlying cause. It can include:\n\nAnti-inflammatory\nPain relief\nJoint supplements\nAntibiotic\nSurgery\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk for lameness\n\nLameness is more likely to occur in:\n\nYounger cats who are very active\nCats who go outside\nOlder cats (with arthritis)\nCats with birth defects like hip dysplasia\nCats who get into fights with the neighbours\nOther causes of lameness or limping in cats\nCat bite abscess:\n\nA very common cause of limping in cats is cat bite abscess.\n\nCat‚Äôs mouths are full of nasty bacteria. One single bite can result in a limping leg due to an abscess and wound.\n\nCheck for any swelling or scabs on your limping cat.\n\nSpine or disc problems:\n\nBack problems are less seen in cats then in dogs, but can be a cause of lameness. When they happen are more related to a traumatic event (being hit by a car or a falling). Paralysis of one or more limbs can be a result of this.\n\nAfter any traumatic accident you should always take your cat to a vet. Not all injuries are obvious.\n\nSaddle Clot or Thrombus:\n\nA rare cause of limping is a type of blood clot called a saddle clot or thrombus.\n\nDifferent materials in the blood can travel through the circulation blocking blood supply usually to the back legs.\n\nA saddle thrombus is an emergency!\n\nContact your local vet for an urgent appointment.\nCall Joii vets to help you identify the symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of a saddle clot include:\n\nSudden onset\nSevere pain\nExtreme lameness and even paralysis in one or both back legs\nPaw and limb cold to touch\n\nSaddle clots are most likely in cats with other illnesses:\n\nHeart disease\nOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Sadly, the more common ones are infections and tumours, and veterinary treatment will usually be required.\n\nLumps can happen due to infection, inflammation, an abnormal growth, fluid build-up, or an anatomical problem like a hernia. You can check a list of some common causes and read a brief explanation below.\n\nWhat to do if you find a lump on your cat\n\nIf your cat has a bleeding lump, apply gentle pressure to the area for 60 seconds. If the bleeding continues or is severe, continue applying pressure but contact a vet for further advice straight away. Even if the bleeding stops, it is likely to happen again, and a vet assessment is recommended.\n\nIf the lump is painful or your cat is unwell, for example, hiding away or refusing to eat, they may have an abscess or injury. Contact a vet for further advice immediately.\n\nIf your cat is completely normal apart from the lump, monitor them closely and contact your vet when possible. It can be very useful to take photos of the area where you see or feel the lump. If possible, measuring the lump is also helpful.\n\nCommon causes of lumps in cats\nInfections and abscesses are a common cause of lumps in cats, often caused by fighting with other cats. Usually, these lumps are around the face, lower parts of the legs, lower back or near the base of the tail. There may be a scab in the middle of the lump.\nA small lump is common after an injection, especially after vaccines in kittens. This usually resolves after 3-6 weeks. If it becomes bigger than 2cm, is still growing after a month or is still present after 3 months, testing is recommended.\nAllergic reactions can cause multiple small, scabby lumps all over the cat‚Äôs body. They can also cause a small, red lump to develop near the lips¬†or a red raised area on their tummy or back legs.\nLumps can be due to a tumour or growth. About 50% of growths on a cat‚Äôs skin are cancerous, so it is advisable to test any lumps if unsure of their cause. Common examples are squamous cell carcinomas, fibrosarcomas, mast cell tumours, basal cell tumours or¬†warts.\nCysts related to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles are common. These are not dangerous but can cause irritation and get infected.\nUmbilical hernias can cause a small lump in very young kittens. This is when the space where the umbilical cord was does not close properly. Abdominal fat squeezes through the muscle and can be felt under the skin. Small hernias should close on their own, but larger ones may need surgery.\nHernias can also happen after a traumatic injury, like a road traffic accident or fall. These require urgent treatment.\n\nWhen should I worry? What do cancerous lumps look like?\n\nIf a lump is painful or your cat is unwell, a vet assessment should be done as soon as possible. Joii can¬†help you decide if an emergency vet visit is necessary.\n\nNo one can tell if a lump is cancerous just from the way it looks or feels. Testing is recommended, especially if the lump is growing rapidly or surrounded by redness and inflammation.\n\nCan I prevent lumps on my cat?\n\nNeutering reduces many of the behaviours that increase the risk of injuries and abscesses, like roaming and fighting.\n\nReducing sunbathing or using a protective cat sun cream may reduce the risk of a type of skin tumour, especially in white cats.\n\nWhat should I look out for if I find a lump on my cat?\n\nIf your cat is sleeping more, hiding, or their temperament suddenly changes, they may be in pain.\n\nChanges in appetite or weight loss are very significant.\n\nSome benign growths can turn malignant. If a lump has been present for a while but suddenly changes, this should be checked.\n\nHow can I help my cat with their lump?\n\nIf a lump starts bleeding, applying gentle pressure for 60 seconds may stop this. If not, seek help from a vet.\n\nBandages can cause damage to the lump or skin if applied incorrectly. It is usually better to use a recovery collar or a medical vest to prevent injury.\n\nIf a lump ruptures and is draining fluid, clean the area thoroughly with saline (roughly 1 tsp salt/500ml cooled boiled water) and seek advice from a vet.\n\nWhat is the vet treatment for lumps on cats?\nPain medication will be prescribed when necessary.\nAbscesses will need to be drained and flushed to remove the infectious material. Antibiotics may also be necessary.\nSuspected allergies may be treated with steroid medications. Further investigations may be advised to determine the trigger for the allergic reaction.\nIf a growth or tumour is suspected, one of the two tests below can be performed before deciding if surgical removal is the best treatment:\nA fine needle aspiration involves scraping a few cells from within the lump with a needle. This is usually a simple test to perform and can provide a lot of information, but the results may be inconclusive.\nFor a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy may be required. This involves removing a portion or the whole of the lump under anaesthesia.\n\nIs my cat at higher risk of having lumps?\n\nYoung male cats more frequently get abscesses and injuries, especially if unneutered.\n\nOlder cats are more likely to have a tumour.\n\nWhite or partially white cats are at higher risk of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, especially if they spend a lot of time sunbathing.\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of lumps in cats\n\nSometimes fluid or blood can build up after surgery or an injury and form a lump under the skin. This is likely to resolve by itself but should be checked by a vet to be safe.\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

These are most common on the paws, face, neck, tail and anal sacs. A wound is not always visible. Abscesses can sometimes burst and drain pus.\n\nAllergic reactions can cause multiple red, raised wheals all over the dog‚Äôs body, especially their back and sides.\n\nAllergies can also lead to nodules forming between the toes, usually called interdigital cysts or granulomas.\n\nLumps can be due to a tumour or growth. Many of these are benign, such as¬†warts, but cancerous lumps are still common. A vet assessment is recommended. This is more urgent if the lump is red, sore, or growing rapidly.\n\nLymphoma can cause swelling of one or more lymph nodes, and this can be noticed as one or more lumps under the skin. This should be assessed by a vet as soon as possible.\n\nFatty lumps, or lipomas, are common in older and overweight dogs and are almost always benign. These are often very soft to the touch and move freely under the skin. They can still cause trouble if growing rapidly, especially if they are near areas of movement such as the groin or axilla.\n\nCysts related to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles are common. These are not dangerous but can cause irritation and get infected. If this happens, surgical removal is recommended.\n\nUmbilical and inguinal hernias can cause belly or groin lumps in puppies. This is when the space for the umbilical cord or inguinal canal does not close properly. Some abdominal material squeezes through the muscle and can be felt under the skin.

This infectious bacterial disease can infect humans through a tick bite. You cannot contract the disease from your cat.¬†\n\nYou should remove a tick as soon as you see it, as the longer it stays attached, the greater the risk of disease transmission. Signs of this disease only appear a few months after the tick bite. If you see a tick on your cat, make sure to report it to your vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Lyme disease in cats?\nLyme disease is caused by a bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi.\nThis disease is rare in cats.\nThe prevalence of ticks on cats in the UK is relatively low (6.6%).\nCats can catch this bacteria when bitten by an infected tick.\nIt can affect joints, kidneys, and, less commonly, the nervous system.\nAfter being bitten by an infected tick, the majority of cats do not develop Lyme disease.\nTransmission of the bacteria takes time, it may only occur after 12 to 48 hours of tick attachment.\nSome cats exposed to this bacteria may not show signs of illness.\nIt usually takes 2 to 5 months after the bite for symptoms to appear.\nKeep a note of when you see a tick on your cat so you can tell your vet if they get sick in the future.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of Lyme disease in cats\n\nCats with Lyme disease tend to show vague symptoms that come and go and differ from one to the next. Symptoms include:\n\nLimping and/or stiff gait (walking pattern)\nWeakness (lethargy)\nReduced appetite\nFever\nDifficulty breathing\n\n¬†\n\nCats at higher risk of Lyme disease\n\nThe risk of catching Lyme disease is higher:\n\nFor cats that spend more time outdoors in woodlands and moorland areas.\nIf your cat lives in or travels to a high-risk area in the UK or abroad. See the UK map of endemic areas here.\n\nAs a result of climate change, the UK‚Äôs tick population is increasing.\n\nOther diseases that can be transmitted by ticks, such as Babesiosis, may start to appear in our pets too.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed in cats?\n\nDiagnosing this disease is very challenging because:\n\nThe symptoms seen in this condition are not very specific and are similar to other diseases.\nThere may be several months between the tick bite and the onset of the disease.\nDiagnostic tests available for this disease are challenging.\n\nYour vet may make a diagnosis based on:\n\nYour cat‚Äôs symptoms and history of tick exposure.\nIn-clinic blood test kits to look for antibodies. This test detects antibodies produced by exposure to bacteria. It takes time for the body to create antibodies, we usually wait around 4 weeks after the tick bite to perform this test.\nOther blood tests to confirm infection or monitor treatment:\nLyme quantitative C6: this test can be used to further investigate a positive in-clinic blood test or evaluate your cat after treatment.\nBorrelia PCR: this test is sometimes performed on blood or biopsy samples from affected tissues or joint fluid and identifies DNA from the bacteria that causes this disease.\n\nTo rule out other medical conditions, your vet may need to perform:\n\nOther blood tests\nUrine tests\nRadiographs (x-rays)\nUltrasound scans\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat Lyme disease in cats?\n\nYour cat will need:\n\nA long course of antibiotics. Usually for 4 weeks with a combination of two or three antibiotics.\nAnti-inflammatories.\nMore complicated cases may require hospitalisation to receive intravenous fluids and be closely monitored.\n\nThe sooner the disease is detected, the better the outcome.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your cat with Lyme disease at home\n\nFor a sick patient to recover, love and care are essential.\n\nAllow them to rest: Ensure you can provide a safe, quiet place for them to sleep.\nHelp them eat: Add small pieces of warm, smelly food to their meals (e.g. sardines, anchovies, tuna, chicken).\nMonitor them closely.\n\nIf you need help giving tablets to your dog, call our Joii team for help.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to prevent Lyme disease in cats\n\nThere are a few things you can do to prevent this disease:\n\nKeep your cat up to date with parasite control that covers ticks.\nMonitor yourself and your cat for any ticks on the body.\nMake sure to remove the full tick from your cat including the mouth part of the tick.\nAvoid crushing the tick with your fingers.\n\nFor more information, you can also visit our article on Ticks in cats.\n\nTick protection products\n\nVeterinary products are available in a variety of forms for preventing tick attachment or quickly killing them if they attach:\n\nSpot-on‚Äôs\nCollars\nTablets\nExamine your cat and yourself\n\nTicks are seen all year, but mainly between March and November.\n\nIf your cat goes outdoors, check them frequently. Ticks are most commonly seen on the head, ears, armpits, and belly, but can be found anywhere.\n\nTicks can also be present in gardens.\n\nHumans can also be bitten by ticks, so check yourself.\n\nBe more cautious when visiting abroad or high-risk areas.

You cannot contract the disease from your dog, only from a tick bite.¬†\n\nYou should remove a tick as soon as you see it, as the longer it stays attached, the greater the risk of disease transmission. Signs of this disease only manifest a few months after the tick bite. If you see a tick on your dog, make sure to report it to your vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is Lyme disease in dogs?\nLyme disease is caused by a bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi.\nDogs can catch this disease when bitten by an infected tick.\nJoints are the most often affected, but it can also affect the kidneys and, less commonly, the nervous system.\nThe majority of dogs do not develop Lyme disease after being bitten by an infected tick.\nThere‚Äôs a 2.6% chance of getting Lyme disease after a tick bite.\nTransmission of the bacteria requires time, it may only occur after 12 to 48 hours of tick attachment.\nSome dogs exposed to this bacteria may not show signs of illness.\nIt usually takes 2 to 5 months after the bite for symptoms to appear.\nKeep a note of when you see a tick on your dog so you can tell your vet if your dog gets sick in the future.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of Lyme disease in dogs\n\nDogs with Lyme disease tend to show vague symptoms that come and go and differ from one to the next. Symptoms include:\n\nLimping and/or stiff gait (walking pattern)\nWeakness (lethargy)\nReduced appetite\nSwollen joints\nFever\nSwollen lymph nodes (glands)\nVomiting\nIncreased drinking and urination in cases of kidney infection\n\n¬†\n\nDogs at higher risk of Lyme disease\n\nThe risk of getting Lyme disease is higher:\n\nFor dogs that spend more time outdoors in woodlands and moorland areas.\nIf your dog lives in or travels to a high-risk area in the UK or abroad. See the UK map of endemic areas here.\n\nAs a result of climate change, the UK‚Äôs tick population has increased.\n\nOther diseases that can be transmitted by ticks (such as Babesiosis) may start to be seen in our pets too.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed in dogs?\n\nDiagnosing this disease is very challenging because:\n\nThe symptoms seen in this condition are not very specific and are similar to other diseases.\nThere may be several months between the tick bite and the onset of the disease.\nDiagnostic tests available for this disease are challenging.\n\nYour vet may make a diagnosis based on:\n\nYour dog‚Äôs symptoms and history of tick exposure.\nIn-clinic blood test kits to look for antibodies. This test detects antibodies produced by exposure to bacteria. It takes time for the body to create antibodies, we usually wait around 4 weeks after the tick bite to perform this test.\nOther blood tests to confirm infection or monitor treatment:\nLyme quantitative C6: This test can be used to further investigate a positive in-clinic blood test or evaluate your dog after treatment.\nBorrelia PCR: This test is sometimes performed on blood or biopsy samples from affected tissues or joint fluid and identifies DNA from the bacteria that causes this disease.\n\nTo rule out other medical conditions, your vet may need to perform:\n\nOther blood tests\nUrine tests\nRadiographs (x-rays)\nUltrasound scans\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat Lyme disease in dogs?\n\nYour dog will need:\n\nA long course of antibiotics. Usually for 4 weeks with a combination of two or three antibiotics.\nAnti-inflammatories.\nMore complicated cases may require hospitalisation to receive intravenous fluids and close monitoring.\n\nThe sooner the disease is detected, the better the outcome.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to help your dog with Lyme disease\n\nFor a sick patient to recover, love and care are essential.\n\nAllow them to rest: Ensure you can provide a safe, quiet place for them to sleep.\nHelp them eat: Feed soft, bland food, such as boiled chicken or scrambled eggs. Warm up their food.\nMonitor them closely.\n\nIf you need help giving tablets to your dog, call our Joii team for help.\n\n\n¬†\n\nHow to prevent Lyme disease\n\nThere are a few things you can do to prevent this disease:\n\nKeep your dog up to date with parasite control that covers ticks.\nMonitor yourself and your dog for any ticks on the body.\nMake sure to remove the full tick from your dog, including the mouth part of the tick.\nAvoid crushing the tick with your fingers.\nYour vet may recommend the Lyme vaccine.\n\nFor more information, you can also visit our article on Ticks in dogs.\n\nTick protection products\n\nVeterinary products are available in a variety of forms for preventing tick attachment or quickly killing them if they attach:\n\nSpot-on‚Äôs\nCollars\nTablets\nExamine your dog and yourself\n\nTicks are seen all year, but mainly between March and November.\n\nThoroughly check yourself and your dog after a walk. They are most commonly seen on the head, ears, armpits, and belly, but can be found anywhere.\n\nTicks can also be present in gardens.\n\nBe more cautious when visiting abroad or in high-risk areas.

If caught early, treatment is usually successful, and the outlook is excellent.\n\nWhat is mange?\n\nMange is a¬†parasitic¬†skin disease caused by tiny mites that live under the surface of the skin and in the hair follicles. These mites are so small that they are not visible to the eye.\n\nMange is caused by two different types of mites in cats: sarcoptes and demodex.\n\nDemodex is also known as Demodicosis. It is fairly uncommon in cats.\n\nIt is species-specific, so it does not spread from cats to humans or dogs.\nOne form of Demodex can be spread between cats.\nIt can affect any age but is most common in young cats and cats with a weakened immune system, such as those with feline immunodeficiency virus or feline leukaemia virus.\n\nSarcoptes is also known as Scabies. It is also fairly uncommon but highly contagious.\n\nIt can be spread from other animals by direct contact and shared bedding, toys, and grooming equipment.\nIt can affect both indoor and outdoor cats. Scabies can spread quickly in stray cat populations.\n\n¬†\n\nIf left untreated, mange can worsen and lead to a secondary bacterial infection in the skin. Speak to a vet as soon as possible if you are concerned about mange. Our Joii team are available 24 hours a day.\n\nHow to tell if your cat has mange\n\nYour cat may develop one or more of the following signs with mange\n\nHair loss can be one of the early stages.\nItching, licking, or biting at the skin. This can range from mild to very severe.\nRed, inflamed, crusty, or scabby skin\nThickened skin\nEar infections\nLip ulcers\nLethargy\nHair loss is one of the first signs of mange\n\n¬†\n\nSarcoptic mange\n\nSymptoms usually begin around non-haired areas, such as the ears, armpits, and tummy, but can spread all over the body.\nScabies lesions in a cat\n\nDemodectic mange can be\n\nLocalised: found commonly on the face, head, and neck.\nGeneralised: when the lesions appear all over the body.\nLesions often start around the face\n\nAre some cats at greater risk of mange than others?\nCats with weaker immune systems are more at risk. This includes cats that are elderly, very young, or have current health issues such as diabetes, FIV, or FeLV.\nThere are some breeds that have been linked to an increased risk of demodex, such as Siamese and Burmese.\n\n¬†\n\nCan humans catch mange from cats?\nSarcoptic mange can spread to other cats, dogs, and even humans. The symptoms in humans are usually very mild, as they cannot live on the skin for very long. The main symptom is itching. We recommend¬†speaking to your GP¬†to discuss whether treatment is needed.\n\nHow is mange in cats diagnosed?\nYour vet will usually diagnose mange based on the way the skin appears and by looking at skin scrapes or tape smears under a microscope.\nThey may also be found by a hair pluck sample or skin biopsy.\nSome types of mange can be difficult to diagnose, so your vet may do a medication trial even if the skin scrapes are negative.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for mange in cats?\nMedication is used to kill the mites, usually a tablet or spot-on. This is only available as a prescription medication. Over-the-counter products are not effective against mites. Repeated doses for several months may be required.\nOral antibiotics, shampoos, or creams for any secondary bacterial skin infection.\nAnti-itch or anti-inflammatory medication may also be needed.\nThe cost of treating mange varies depending on the circumstances. Sometimes medication to kill the mites is all that is needed. Costs may be higher if there is a secondary skin infection because other medications will be needed.\n\nYour vet might also perform tests to check for underlying health conditions such as feline leukaemia, feline immunodeficiency, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and allergic or auto-immune skin conditions.\n\nWhat to do at home if your cat has mange\n\nOne form of¬†demodectic mange¬†can be contagious, so we recommend routinely cleaning all toys, bedding, and collars if your cat has been diagnosed with this. All cats in the household will also need treatment.\n\nThe following guidelines apply only to¬†sarcoptic mange, which is highly contagious:\n\nIsolate your cat from other animals until the mites have cleared.\nStandard household disinfectants are effective against mites. Use these for any surfaces and furniture your cat has been in contact with. The mites do not survive very long in the environment.\nWash all of their bedding, your bedding, clothes, harnesses, and blankets in a hot wash¬†(50¬∞C or higher).\nTreat all other pets that have been in regular, close contact. The only medication effective against mites is only available on prescription.\n\n¬†\n\nNatural remedies and supplements can also be used, alongside prescription medication, to help reduce the symptoms. Supplements containing essential omega oils can help protect the skin barrier. Shampoos or mousses can help soothe and protect the skin.\n\nSpeak to our Joii team today to find out more.\n\nTips on how to prevent mange in cats\nSome prescription anti-flea and deworming medications also prevent and treat mites. Your local vet should be able to prescribe this for you.\nBrush your cat regularly and check for any abnormalities in the fur and skin.\nClean your cat‚Äôs bowls, blankets, and collars often.\nFeed your cat good-quality food and make sure they have a healthy weight.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\n\nWhat to do if you are worried about mange in cats\n\nSeek help from a vet if:\n\nYour cat has swollen lymph nodes or is lethargic.\nYour cat‚Äôs skin lesions¬†have spread all over their body.\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYour cat is itchy or has mild skin problems.\nYou have any questions about skin supplements for cats.\nYou have any questions about parasite control in cats.\nYou have any questions about your cat‚Äôs nutrition or weight.\n\nRead our articles to find out other conditions that can make your cat Itchy, or cause Pain or¬†Stress\n\n 1 0\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

The condition affects cats of any age, sex or breed, although cats over 7 years old and Siamese cats are most at risk. Up to 40% of all UK cats will get pancreatitis at some time in their lives.\n\nThe pancreas is a gland in your cat‚Äôs tummy. It produces powerful chemicals to digest food in the intestines. Sometimes the gland becomes swollen and painful.¬† Symptoms of pancreatitis include not eating, lethargy and diarrhoea. Around 50% of cats who get pancreatitis also have an inflamed small intestine and liver, a condition called triaditis. Pancreatitis needs to be treated by a vet, and not all cats recover from the illness. For cats who do recover, pancreatitis can lead to longer-term illness.\n\nWhat is pancreatitis in cats?\n\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is a small¬† gland located in your cat‚Äôs abdomen, close to their stomach\n\n¬†\n\nIt has 2 important functions:\n\nCreating powerful¬†digestive enzymes¬†(digestive juices) to break down food\nProducing the hormone¬†insulin, which lowers glucose (sugar) levels in your cat‚Äôs blood\n\nPancreatitis may be sudden (acute), or it may come on gradually and last longer (chronic)\n\nChronic pancreatitis is more common in cats (unlike dogs)\n\nCats who have had one bout of pancreatitis are more likely to suffer another one sometime in the future\n\nWhen the pancreas gets¬†badly¬†damaged, your cat may become unable to digest food (EPI). It¬†can also lead to sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus)\n\n¬†\n\nHow does pancreatitis happen?\nPowerful digestive enzymes (digestive juices) produced inside the pancreas start to work too soon\nThe pancreas gets damaged\nThe gland becomes swollen and inflamed\nNeighbouring organs, including the liver and small intestine become inflamed\n\nIn around 95% of cases, the actual cause of pancreatitis isn‚Äôt known. Vets call this ‚Äòidiopathic‚Äô.\n\n¬†\n\nPossible triggers for pancreatitis\nOther illnesses, including sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and inflammatory bowel disease\nInfections and parasites (for example, toxoplasmosis)\nObesity, which can be associated with higher levels of fats (called lipids) in the bloodstream\nToxins, including chocolate, lilies, zinc and organophosphates\nA blow to the abdomen (tummy) causing direct injury to the pancreas\nEating food with too much fat in it.\n\n¬†\n\nTriaditis\n\nYour cat‚Äôs pancreas works very closely with their small intestine, gallbladder and liver. The pancreas shares a duct (or pipe) with the gallbladder for transfer of digestive juices into the small intestine. The gallbladder sits in your cat‚Äôs liver and produces bile. Bile helps to digest fats in food. So it‚Äôs very easy for infection or inflammation to spread from the small intestine to the pancreas. and from pancreas to gallbladder and liver. This is one reason why up to 50% of cats with pancreatitis also have inflammation of their liver and small intestine. This condition is called triaditis.\n\nSymptoms of pancreatitis in Cats\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of acute pancreatitis\nNot wanting to eat\nHaving less energy\nDiarrhoea or soft stool (poo)\nSigns of tummy pain, including lip smacking, being restless, looking hunched\nVomiting¬†(being sick)\nCollapse\n\n¬†\n\n¬†Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis\n\nSymptoms are similar, but come on more gradually\n\nGoing off food intermittently\nDiarrhoea\nDrinking more\nHaving less energy\nVomiting intermittently (from time to time)\nLosing weight\n\nCats are more likely to get the chronic form of pancreatitis. Since the symptoms mimic other common conditions in cats, chronic pancreatitis can be difficult to identify in the early stages of the illness.\n\nCats at higher risk of developing pancreatitis\nCats who are obese (overweight)\nCats with other health problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease and sugar diabetes (diabetes mellitus)\nCats receiving steroid treatment\nSiamese cats with a gene that causes high levels of fat in their blood\n\n¬†\n\nHow to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in cats\n\nWe don‚Äôt know for certain what causes pancreatitis in cats, so we can‚Äôt prevent it. However, you can reduce your cat‚Äôs risk by:\n\nEnsuring your cat eats a healthy diet\nControlling your cat‚Äôs weight\nTreating and monitoring other illnesses under veterinary advice\nBeing especially careful with the above tips if your cat is in a¬†higher risk group or breed¬†\n\nHow do vets diagnose pancreatitis in cats?\n\nThere‚Äôs no specific test for pancreatitis.

Depending on the severity, the treatment can range from only exercise control to surgery.¬†\n\nPatellar luxation is relatively uncommon in cats and is usually a developmental condition. Cats with patellar luxation aren‚Äôt always lame.\n\nWhat is patella luxation in cats?\n\nA healthy knee cap, called patella, should never slide or pop out of the femoral grove. If so, we call it a luxating patella or dislocating patella.\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to its occurrence, such as:\n\nGrowth-related changes in the joint or leg (developmental abnormalities).\nJoint or leg structure changes that are inherited (hereditary).\nTraumatic injury.\n\nThe majority of cats will have both knees involved.\n\nCats with patellar luxation aren‚Äôt always lame.\n\nThe severity of lameness does not always correlate with the grade of luxation.\n\nSome movement of the patella in the knee grove may be considered normal in healthy cats due to their knees being slightly different from dogs.\n\nSymptoms of patella luxation in cats\n\nPatellar dislocation symptoms:\n\nCan be an incidental finding detected by your vet on a routine physical examination.\nLameness may or may not be present.\nLameness may present as occasional locking of the knee or a shuffling or crouching walk.\nSudden inactivity or inability to jump.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of patella luxation than others?\nDevon rex and Abyssinian cats may be more prone. But domestic shorthair cats are overrepresented.\nDevelopmental patellar luxation occurs at a young age but may be diagnosed at any age.\nCommon coexisting conditions\nArthritis can occur as a result of this condition\nThe knee cap may dislocate more often over time, damaging cartilage and eventually exposing the bone, causing arthritis and pain.\nArthritis in the hip joint may be present in up to 40% of cats with patellar luxation.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is patella luxation diagnosed?\n\nYour vet will do a hands-on orthopaedic examination and will feel the patella move out of place. Then they will grade it based on its severity.\n\nGrade 1: The patella can slip out of place with hand manipulation but can easily be placed back in position. This grade doesn‚Äôt usually cause much of a problem.\n\nMild patellar subluxation (grade <I) may be noted in healthy cats.\n\nGrade 2: The patella will occasionally slip out of place during your cat‚Äôs normal movement but can easily be placed back in position.\n\nGrade 3: The patella is out of place most of the time but can be moved back into normal position.\n\nGrade 4: The patella is out of place and cannot be moved back into normal position.\n\nRadiographs (x-rays) may be necessary to assess your cat‚Äôs condition and rule out other problems. Sometimes, CT scans are also necessary.\n\nVet treatment for cats with patella luxation\n\nYour vet might recommend medical treatment and/or surgery based on your cat‚Äôs needs:\n\nMedical management\nMedication to control inflammation and pain.\nJoint supplements and other arthritis management medications.\nDiet and exercise management. Weight control will also reduce pain.\nAdditional treatments such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, massage, stem cell therapy, and laser therapy can be beneficial.\nWe have an article on arthritis that offers more information about joint supplements and how to find qualified professionals to help you.\nSurgical treatment\nThose experiencing chronic pain or cats with a grade greater than 2 may need surgery. Referral to a board-certified veterinary surgeon is usually necessary.\nThe vet may recommend the following surgeries:\nTibial tuberosity transposition\nTrochlear block recession\nSoft tissue reconstruction\nSurgery may be less effective in cats with severe arthritis.\n\n¬†\n\nHome management of a cat with patella luxation\n\nFollow your vet‚Äôs recommendation and exercise restriction plan.\n\nIf your cat had surgery, your vet‚Äôs plan will be very detailed for the first 6-8 weeks.\nKeep your cat rested by using a cage or leaving them in small rooms of the house with no access to high furniture.\nKeep their minds busy by feeding them in slow feeders and play mats.\nStart physiotherapy as soon as possible and continue for the following 3-6 months as necessary. The sessions will change as the bone heals and the main goal changes.\nA healthy weight is essential. You can check your cat‚Äôs body condition score below. Vet nurses can help with weight loss advice.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in cats\nWill your cat be able to exercise normally after patellar luxation surgery?\n\nYour cat should be able to exercise normally after a reevaluation with your orthopaedic surgeon and, ideally, physiotherapy. It takes at least 6-8 weeks.\n\nHow to prevent patella luxation\n\nIt is not always possible to prevent this disease. Due to its inherited cause, we can avoid passing it on to future generations by not breeding cats with patella luxation.\n\nWhen should you be worried about your cat with patella luxation disease\n\nIf your cat was diagnosed with patella luxation, contact your local vet practice if they:\n\nDo not improve despite treatment.\nKeep limping or walking abnormally.\nStruggle to run, jump, or use the stairs.\nAre vocalising and unwilling to use the leg.\nHave vomiting, diarrhoea, or loss of appetite when medication has been prescribed.\n\nJoii can help:\n\nIf your cat had surgery and you need tips to keep them calm and rested at home.\nIf your cat is vomiting, has diarrhoea, or a loss of appetite, when medication has been prescribed.\nIf you need help and advice on slowing the progression of arthritis.\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

If so, we call it a luxating or dislocating patella.\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to its occurrence, such as:\n\nJoint or leg structure changes that are inherited (hereditary).\nGrowth related changes in the joint or leg (developmental abnormalities).\nTraumatic injury.\n\nApproximately 50% of affected dogs have both knees involved.\n\nFor dogs that require surgery, outcomes are better if surgery is performed before advanced arthritis develops or additional ligament injury occurs, such as cruciate ligament disease.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of patella luxation in dogs\n\nPatellar dislocation symptoms vary greatly with the severity of the disease:\n\nCan be an incidental finding detected by your vet on a routine physical examination.\nYour dog may suddenly carry the leg up for a few steps (skipping).\nThey can shake or extend the leg while walking or running.\nIn young puppies with severe medial patellar luxation, the rear legs often have a ‚Äúbow-legged‚Äù appearance that worsens with growth.\nLarge breed dogs may have a ‚Äúknocked-in knee‚Äù appearance.\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of patella luxation than others?\n\nSmall breed dogs, such as Boston and Yorkshire Terriers, Bichon Frise, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Miniature Poodles are more prone.\n\nBut it can also occur in large breeds, where Chinese Shar Peis, Flat-Coated Retrievers, Akitas, and Great Pyrenees are more likely to have it.\n\nCommon coexisting conditions\n\nIn addition to patella dislocation, the following conditions can occur:\n\nArthritis: the knee cap may dislocate more often over time, damaging cartilage and eventually exposing the bone, causing arthritis and pain.\nCranial cruciate ligament disease: ligaments in the knee may become strained, ultimately leading to rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. <link to Cranial cruciate ligament disease>\nTendinitis: inflammation of knee ligaments.\nLimb deformities: in puppies, the abnormal position of the patella may also lead to serious bone deformation of the leg.\n\n¬†\n\nHow is patella luxation diagnosed?\n\nYour vet will do a hands-on orthopaedic examination and feel the patella move out of place. Then they will grade it based on its severity.\n\nGrade 1: The patella can slip out of place with hand manipulation but can easily be placed back in position. This grade doesn‚Äôt usually cause much of a problem.\n\nGrade 2: The patella will occasionally slip out of place during your dog‚Äôs normal movement but can easily be placed back in position.\n\nGrade 3: The patella is out of place most of the time but can be moved back into normal position.\n\nGrade 4: The patella is out of place and cannot be moved back into normal position.\n\nRadiographs (x-rays) may be necessary to assess your dog‚Äôs condition and rule out other problems. Sometimes, CT scans are also necessary.\n\n¬†\n\nVet treatment for dogs with patella luxation\n\nYour vet might recommend medical treatment and/or surgery based on your dog‚Äôs needs:\n\nMedical management\nMedication to control inflammation and pain.\nJoint supplements and other arthritis management medications. Diet and exercise management: Weight control will also help to reduce pain.\nAdditional treatments, such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, massage, stem cell therapy, and laser therapy, can be beneficial.\nWe have an article on arthritis that offers more information about joint supplements and how to find qualified professionals to help you.\nSurgical treatment\nSurgery may be recommended for those experiencing chronic pain or dogs that have developed a grade 3 or 4 luxating patella. In some cases, dogs with grade 2 luxations may also benefit from surgery. Referral to a specialist vet is usually necessary.\nThe vet may recommend the following surgeries:\nTibial tuberosity transposition\nDistal femoral varus osteotomy\nTrochlear block recession\nSoft tissue reconstruction\n\n¬†\n\nHome management of a dog with patella luxation\n\nFollow your vet‚Äôs recommendation and exercise restriction plan.\n\nIf your dog had surgery, your vet‚Äôs plan will be very detailed for the first 6-8 weeks.\nKeep your dog rested by using a cage or leaving them in small rooms of the house with no access to high furniture (sofa or bed).\nKeep their minds busy by feeding them in slow feeders and play mats.\nStart physiotherapy as soon as possible and continue for the following 3-6 months. The sessions will change as the bone heals and the main goal changes.\nA healthy weight is essential. Check your dog‚Äôs body condition score below. Vet nurses can help with advice on weight loss.\nBody Condition Scoring (BCS) in dogs\nWill your dog be able to exercise normally after patellar luxation surgery?\n\nYour dog should be able to exercise normally after a reevaluation with your orthopaedic surgeon and physiotherapy. It takes at least 6-8 weeks.\n\nWhat to expect when your dog has patella luxation?\n\nGrade 1: Don‚Äôt often show symptoms or require treatment. However, they should be monitored to make sure their symptoms don‚Äôt get worse.\n\nGrade 2: When managed carefully with the correct treatment, they often do extremely well and are able to live a happy, pain-free life.\n\nGrades 3-4: Do well if they have corrective surgery. Unfortunately, without surgery, dogs with high-grade patella luxation tend to suffer from mobility problems and pain throughout their lives.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to be aware that even with treatment, most dogs with patella luxation develop arthritis in their knees later in life. Learn more about arthritis symptoms in our article or speak to a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to prevent patella luxation\n\nIt‚Äôs not always possible to prevent this disease. Due to its inherited cause, we can avoid passing it on to future generations by not breeding dogs that have been diagnosed with patella luxation.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen should you be worried about your dog with patella luxation?\n\nIf your dog was diagnosed with patella luxation, contact your local vet practice if they:\n\nDo not improve despite treatment.\nKeep limping, hopping, or walking abnormally.\nStruggle to run, jump, or use the stairs.\nHave vomiting, diarrhoea, or loss of appetite when medication has been prescribed.\n\nJoii can help:\n\nIf your dog had surgery and you need tips to keep them calm and rested at home.\nIf your dog is vomiting, has diarrhoea, or has no appetite when medication has been prescribed.\nIf you need help and advice on slowing the progression of arthritis.\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Pyometra is uncommon in cats, affecting around 2% of unspayed cats (queens) by the time they are 13. However, without treatment, the condition is fatal.\n\nPyometra means ‚Äòpus in the womb‚Äô (uterus) and it‚Äôs a medical emergency. Cats with pyometra need surgery to remove the diseased uterus. But the operation is risky because your cat is so poorly. Surgery is expensive, and the outlook depends on how quickly the condition is identified and treated. The best way to protect your cat against pyometra is to spay (neuter) her.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is pyometra in cats?\n\nPyometra happens because of hormone changes after your queen‚Äôs season\n\nHormones thicken the womb lining\nThe womb produces more fluid\nBacteria get into the womb more easily and infection leads to pus\nPus in her womb makes your queen very sick\nInfection can spread into the bloodstream, leading to organ failure, including the kidneys and heart\nSometimes the swollen uterus bursts, and pus escapes into the abdomen.\nPus in the abdomen (septic peritonitis) becomes life-threatening very rapidly.\n\n¬†\n\nVets describe pyometra as ‚Äòopen‚Äô or ‚Äòclosed‚Äô.\n\nClosed pyometra\n\nThe muscular cervix guarding the entrance to the womb stays tightly closed.\n\nPus can‚Äôt escape the womb\nNo vaginal discharge so no early warning clues\nGreater risk of womb rupture\nSymptoms become more severe more quickly\nIncreased risk of sepsis and organ failure\nThe outlook is poorer with this form of pyometra, and up to half of affected cats won‚Äôt survive.\n\n¬†\n\nOpen pyometra\n\nThe cervix is open.\n\nPus can drain from the infected womb\nVaginal discharge and/or licking under the tail provide visible clues\nEarlier diagnosis and treatment is possible\nGood outlook with prompt treatment\n\n¬†\n\nStump pyometra\n\nIt‚Äôs a very rare form of pyometra in neutered female cats.\n\nWhen a queen is neutered, her ovaries are removed. This stops the hormones that lead to pyometra. But a small stump of the womb is always left behind after spaying. And if a tiny piece of ovary also remains in the tummy, it can still produce hormones. This can cause pyometra to develop in the stump of womb tissue. Symptoms are like those seen with the other types of pyometra, but more vague and harder to diagnose.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of pyometra in cats\n\nSymptoms of pyometra usually develop up to 4 weeks after your queen‚Äôs last heat ends and include:\n\nEating less\nLethargy and weakness\nDrooling\nSwollen, painful tummy\nVomiting and diarrhoea\nDrinking more\n\nOpen pyometra only:\n\nLicking under the tail\nVaginal discharge ‚Äì bloody, yellow/green or cream/grey- coloured\n\n¬†\n\nWhich cats are most at risk of pyometra?\n\nPyometra only affects unneutered females (queens) and is most common in older queens over 10 years old.\n\nHigher risk groups of queens include:\n\nCertain breeds, including Sphinx, Siamese, Abyssinian, Ragdoll, Maine Coon, and Bengal\nQueens whose seasons have been controlled by steroid hormone injections or tablets\n\nPyometra does not spread between animals or from animals to humans.\n\n¬†\n\nDiagnosis of pyometra in cats\n\nVets diagnose pyometra based on the following:\n\nSymptoms in an unneutered queen between her heats (seasons or ‚Äòcalling‚Äô)\nUltrasound scan\nX-ray\nBlood tests\n\n¬†\n\nHow do vets treat pyometra in cats?\nSurgical treatment\n\nSurgery is the only treatment which will permanently cure pyometra\n\nStabilizing the symptoms: antibiotic injections and life-saving fluids via a drip into your cat‚Äôs leg\nEmergency surgery to remove the diseased womb and ovaries\n\nAntibiotics alone won‚Äôt cure pyometra, not even an open or stump pyometra. It‚Äôs only going to prolong your cat‚Äôs distress, add to the cost, and reduce the likelihood of a positive outcome.\n\n¬†\n\nMedical management\n\nOn very rare occasions, queens who are too old or frail for surgery may be treated with a combination of injections to empty the womb and treat the infection. Injections are repeated over several days, and their effects are monitored by ultrasound scans and blood tests. Although this approach can be successful in the short term, recurrence is likely.\n\n¬†\n\nHome care for cats treated for pyometra\n\nThere are no home remedies for Pyometra.

It is contagious between cats and can also spread to people and other species.

It is contagious between dogs, cats, people, and many other animals. It is usually mild but can be serious in very young or weak animals.\n\nDogs catch ringworm, also known as dermatophytosis, when damaged skin comes into contact with spores shed by an animal with the disease. Direct contact with animals that have it is most common, but hairs and objects can also carry the infection. Healthy animals can clear the disease after a few months, but they can spread it in the meantime. This disease is very contagious but not life-threatening.\n\nWhat is ringworm?\n\nA contagious skin disease that does not affect other organs.\n\nCaught usually from close contact with affected animals.\n\nSeveral species of fungus can cause disease.\n\nHealthy skin is very resistant to infection. Minor skin damage or problems with the immune system will allow infection to set in.\n\nCan look like many other skin conditions.\n\nCan also affect claws.\n\nSerious disease is rare, but treatment is advised to reduce spread.\n\nSymptoms of ringworm in dogs\n\nTypically small patches of hair loss with dry, scaly skin.\n\nMay be itchy, but often isn‚Äôt.\n\nCan cause many different skin changes and may look like many other skin diseases.\n\nIt can be just one spot, many spots, or large areas.\n\nSkin may be dry, red, dark, or swollen.\n\nSometimes there are crusts or scabs.\n\nInfected claws can shed or become deformed.\n\nSome animals will have other conditions, and this can cause other symptoms.\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of getting ringworm than others?\n\nYoung puppies and animals with problems affecting their immune system are most at risk of getting ringworm.\n\nHunting dogs are also at higher risk due to contact with wildlife.\n\nYorkshire Terriers are at risk of developing severe disease.\n\n¬†\n\nCan humans get ringworm from dogs?\n\nRingworm is a zoonosis, this means that humans can get it from dogs and other animals.\n\nChildren and people with a weakened immune system are at higher risk.\n\nContact your GP if any family members develop skin problems, especially round red spots on their skin.\n\nHow is ringworm diagnosed in dogs?\n\nDiagnosis is not always straightforward, as ringworm can look the same as other skin diseases, and some animals can have the fungus on them without having disease.\n\nSome types of ringworm will look fluorescent green under some types of UV light, and this can be checked with a special lamp called a Wood‚Äôs Lamp.\n\nLooking at damaged or shed hairs under the microscope may sometimes detect the fungus.\n\nOne of the best tests available is incubating skin, hair, or claw samples in the lab to see if the fungus grows. This may take up to two weeks.\n\nTests looking for the DNA of the fungus, called PCR tests, can also be used but have limitations.\n\nWhat is the treatment for ringworm in dogs?\n\nSince this is a contagious disease, treatment usually tries to eliminate the fungus and not just the symptoms. As such, tests are needed after the skin gets better to check if the fungus is still around. The approach to treatment will depend on how widespread and how severe the disease is.\n\nSmall areas can sometimes be treated with a prescription ointment.\n\nSpread out or large areas usually need a combination of oral medication and medicated washes or shampoos.\n\nSevere disease often requires long periods of treatment (several months).\n\nIf there are other diseases present, these usually need to get better before the ringworm does.\n\nYou may want to test all other pets and treat them if necessary, otherwise the infection may go back and forth.\n\nEffective treatment requires prescription medications, and using the wrong treatment can make things worse. Always discuss testing and treatment options with your vet.\n\nTips on how to prevent ringworm from spreading\n\nIn dogs, ringworm spreads through spores. These fungal spores are often attached to shed skin scales and hairs.\n\nConfine an affected pet to an area where it has no direct contact with other pets. This area needs to be easy to clean, and this must be done frequently.\n\nHealthy skin can repel infection, but minor abrasions can allow it to break in. Use of gloves and separate clothing are advised when handling an affected pet.\n\nImmunocompromised people and young children should avoid handling affected pets. Frequent and thorough hand washing is very important.\n\nBowls, trays, toys, bedding, and clothing must be washed frequently. Two consecutive washes with the longest program in the washing machine have been shown to eliminate the spores. Use normal detergent.\n\nHousehold cleaning products are also effective, as long as all the hair and dust are removed first.\n\nJoii can help with further advice on the best way to keep your house clean and safe.\n\nIf any family members develop skin problems, especially round red spots on their skin, contact your GP for a consultation.\n\nWhen you should be worried about ringworm\n\nCall a vet to discuss suspected ringworm to make sure your pet gets safe and effective treatment.\n\nIn young puppies, elderly dogs, or those with ongoing health conditions, it may be best to discuss any skin issues with a vet straight away.\n\nThis is more urgent if there is swelling, discharge, or they are damaging the skin while scratching.\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

This is called the pre-ictal phase or aura and may happen up to an hour before the seizure itself.\n\nDuring an aura your dog may be:\n\nRestless and pacing\nWhining\nExceptionally clingy\n\nYou may learn to recognise these cues in your dog and be able to take steps to create a safe environment.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn down the lights\nTurn off the television or music\nTurn off the heating (pets can overheat during seizures)\nCover hard corners and edges of furniture with cushions\nTake other pets and children to a different room\n\nThese steps will reduce stimulation of your pet‚Äôs brain and, in this way, help to reduce electrical stimulation feeding into the seizure.\n\nIf seizures happen regularly, your vet may prescribe sedative medication to give into your pet‚Äôs mouth or bottom.

Sometimes they happen infrequently, maybe once every year or two. However, for dogs with a condition like epilepsy, the first seizure may be followed by more frequent episodes.\n\nThe good news is that most dogs who experience seizures due to epilepsy can go on to live full and active lives. Although the disease cannot be cured, with the right medication and veterinary care, you and your canine best friend can continue to do all the things you enjoy together!\n\n¬†\n\nHow vets investigate seizures\n\nTo find out why your pet has had a seizure, vets will check the following\n\n‚ÄòHistory‚Äô ‚Äì your account of what happened and your pet‚Äôs general health\nGeneral and neurological examination ‚Äì checking things like balance and eyesight\nBlood and urine tests to check for liver or kidney disease, low blood sugar or abnormal electrolyte levels\nMRI or CT scans ‚Äì vets may recommend a closer examination of your dog‚Äôs brain using advanced tests such as MRI\nTests on samples of fluid from around the brain (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF)\n\nThese tests don‚Äôt always find something specifically wrong with your pet.

Use a cotton wool pad soaked in warm water to wipe any discharge from their eyes and nose.\n\nHelp them breathe more easily\n\nPlace them in a steamy room (i.e. the bathroom while someone is showering). This will help break down some of the thick mucus in their airways allowing them to breathe more easily.\nOr you may use a humidifier or nebulizer to clear the nasal passage.\n\nHelp them eat better:¬†Add a small amount of warm, smelly food to their meals (e.g. chicken, minced beef).\n\nRemove irritants:¬†If your dog suffers from allergies, open windows (if safe to do so) to let air in, vacuum your house, and wash bedding regularly.\n\nHow vets treat a sneezing dog\n\nSneezing in dogs is treated by targeting its underlying cause. Treatment options may include:\n\nAnti-inflammatories (steroidal or non-steroidal)\nAntibiotics\nAntihistamines\nAppetite stimulants\nMedication that stimulates the immune system\nHumidifiers or nasal saline drops to help with nasal congestion\nSurgery, if foreign bodies need to be removed or to treat tooth root infections\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of sneezing than others?\n\nDogs with lifelong diseases such as¬†allergies¬†may be more prone to sneezing.\n\nFlat-faced breed dogs¬†(brachycephalic breeds) have a very particular facial shape with short nasal passages making them more likely to sneeze.¬†Find out more about¬†BOAS in dogs.\n\nWorking dogs¬†may be more at risk of inhaling foreign bodies, such as grass seeds.\n\n¬†\n\nOther causes of sneezing in dogs\n\nOther causes of sneezing include¬†benign growths¬†or¬†abnormal conformation of the nose and mouth¬†(seen in flat-breed dogs). These changes create obstruction, irritation, and inflammation that causes them to sneeze.\n\nMalignant tumours¬†are always on the list of possible causes, but they‚Äôre not a common condition. When present they are more likely to occur in older dogs.\n\n¬†\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Stress can affect cats of any age, breed, or sex. Behavioural changes are often the first sign of stress and can be sudden in onset or may develop more gradually.¬†\n\nCats are very good at hiding when they are in pain or stressed. Symptoms of stress are often subtle and hard to spot. It‚Äôs important to contact your vet with any changes in your cat‚Äôs behaviour.\n\nStress can lead to emotional and physical illness. One major physical illness related to stress is urinary blockages in male cats. This is a life-threatening emergency and needs to be treated immediately.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is stress in cats?\n\nStress is a common problem in cats and can appear as changes in their behaviour and physical health. The 2022 PDSA animal wellbeing survey shows that 44% of owners report their cats were showing signs of stress.\n\nFor a happy and healthy life, cats need several key resources\n\nAccess to food, water, a toilet area, a scratching area, a high perch, a play area, and a resting or sleeping area.\nIf these resources are not available, this can lead to them becoming stressed.\nThis is especially important in multi-cat households. The general rule to follow is one resource per cat plus one extra.\nCat owners need to make sure that there are enough resources for their cat(s) and that the resources are easily accessible to them.\n\n¬†\n\nOur Joii team are available 24 hours a day, call us now if you have any concerns with your cat.\n\nWhat can cause stress in cats?\n\nCats are all different, and some are more sensitive to certain changes than others.\n\nLack of key resources\nFood and water bowls too close together or too close to the litter tray\nLitter tray not cleaned regularly, changing the type or litter or tray being too small.\nNot enough litter trays, food, or water bowls for the number of cats in the household\nFood and water bowls or litter trays in busy or noisy areas\nNo access to a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù somewhere to hide\nNo scratching post\nBoredom, not enough mental or physical stimulation\nEnvironment changes\nMoving their bed, food/water bowls, or litter tray to a new area\nMoving home, building work, re-decorating, or new furniture\nAny change in the routine, such as staying at home more than normal, someone moving out, or going on holiday\nPeople visiting or a new baby in the home\nFireworks or unexpected loud noises\nTravelling in the car\nTrips to the vets\nSocial\nInappropriate handling\nPunishment: never punish your cat. This can lead to the worsening of behavioural problems.\nIntroducing new pets to the house.\nLiving in a multi-cat household: some cats prefer to live alone.\nLots of cats in the neighbourhood, especially those trespassing in your garden.\nMedical Conditions\nAny medical condition, illness, or injury can cause stress in cats. It is more with long-term disease and pain, such as kidney disease or Arthritis.\n\nAny changes in your cat‚Äôs environment can lead to stress. It‚Äôs best to anticipate and try to reduce this in plenty of time.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to tell if your cat is stressed\n\nStress in cats can lead to emotional and physical symptoms.\n\nBehavioural signs of stress\nScratching the furniture\nPassing urine or faeces outside of the litter tray\nSpraying around the house: squirting urine horizontally ‚Äì tail usually quivers\nAggression toward other animals or people\nHiding away or becoming withdrawn\nDemanding more attention or affection\nMeowing excessively or pacing around\nExcessive grooming\nIncreased sensitivity to touch, noise, or movements\nCertain body language\nCrouching or not moving\nTail close to the body\nArching back\nEars flat and back\nWide eyes and large pupils\nLicking lips or swallowing\nHissing, spitting, or growling\n\n¬†\n\nStressed facial expressions\n\n¬†\n\nHunched body indicates stress\n\n¬†\n\nStressed body language\nPhysical health\nEating and drinking less or more than normal\nVomiting or diarrhoea\nPoor coat condition: scruffy or matted\nHair loss (alopecia) and skin sores\nWeight loss\nRunny eyes and nose\nEating non-food items, also called PICA\nLow energy (lethargy), sleeping more than normal\nBlood in urine\nSquatting, painful or more frequent urination\n\n¬†\n\nAre some cats more at risk of stress than others?\n\nCats of any age, breed, and sex can become stressed. Like humans, cats are all individuals and react differently to changes in routine.\n\nHowever, some risk factors that can lead to stress include\n\nPregnant cats that are stressed or have incorrect nutrition: the litter will be at a higher risk of developing stress.\nA lack of socialisation as a kitten can lead to fear-related problems in the future.\nRescue cats with pre-existing issues\nMulti-cat households or busy homes\nUnderlying diseases, such as arthritis\nMale, indoor, and obese cats are more likely to develop stress cystitis.\nOlder cats are more at risk of age-related insecurity: this often appears as excessive noise during the night and house soiling.\n\nHow is stress diagnosed in cats\n\nWith any change in behaviour, sudden or gradual, it is best to contact your vet. This is especially urgent if there is physical illness present. Your vet will usually start by investigating potential medical causes. This may include\n\nA clinical examination to check for any abnormalities, including pain\nBlood tests\nUrine tests\nSkin tests, such as a biopsy\nImaging: X-rays or ultrasound\n\n¬†\n\nCertain medical conditions can occur or worsen as a result of stress\n\nOvergrooming and skin problems\nUrinary issues: Stress or Interstitial Cystitis\nCat flu\n\nFurther tests may be needed if your cat has these symptoms.\n\nUrinary issues are often related to stress\nOvergrooming is a sign of stress\n\nOnce medical conditions have been investigated, the next step is to address behavioural causes. It‚Äôs best to speak with a behavioural specialist to help identify underlying causes. They will create a specific plan for your cat‚Äôs individual needs.\n\nBehaviour specialists\nReferral to a behavioural specialist is always beneficial, especially if aggression is involved.\nWhen looking for a behaviourist, check their accreditations. It is important to find someone suitably qualified who uses ethical and up-to-date techniques.\nYour vet will usually be able to help find a suitable behaviourist, as some only work by referral. See the following organisations for more information about behaviour specialists:\n\nABTC (Animal Behaviour and Training Council) is a regulatory body that sets and maintains standards for the profession and has a national register for appropriately qualified animal trainers and behaviourists: https://abtc.org.uk/practitioners/?_abtc_role=clinical-animal-behaviourist\n\nCCAB (Certified Clinical Animal Behaviourist) ‚Äì an accreditation scheme by the ASAB ( association for the study of animal behaviour): https://www.asab.org/ccab-register\n\nFAB (Fellowship of Animal Behaviour Clinicians) has a list of certified members and promotes high ethical standards and up-to-date techniques: https://fabclinicians.org/find-a-behaviourist/\n\nAPBC (Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors) is a network of experienced and qualified counsellors: https://www.apbc.org.uk/find-an-APBC-member/\n\n¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the treatment for stress in cats?\n\nTreatment for stress in cats will depend on whether there are any underlying medical concerns.\n\nTreatment of underlying medical conditions\n\nSkin disease may require:\n\nAntibiotics: may be oral, cream, or shampoos\nAnti-itch medications\nParasite preventatives\nFood trials\n\nUrinary tract disease may need:\n\nPain relief, anti-inflammatory medication\nAntibiotics if infection present\nSpecial food for crystals or obesity if present\nIn the case of male cat urinary blockages: emergency hospitalisation for catheterisation, fluids, and pain relief.\n\nCat flu may require:\n\nAnti-inflammatory medication\nEye drops\nAntibiotics\nTreatment of behavioural problems\n\nUsually involves an adaptation plan for at home together with specific behavioural medications.\n\nFinding the underlying cause(s) and adapting to end or reduce this.

Cats of any age or breed can get tick bites, but cats who go outdoors are at most risk. Ticks can spread a serious illness called Lyme disease.\n\nTicks are the size of tiny seeds when they first latch on to your cat. They stay attached to grow and feed for up to 5 days. Ticks can transfer disease by passing infections between animals when they feed on their blood. They have 8 legs and look a bit like spiders. Lyme disease is the most serious disease spread by ticks in the UK.¬† However, Lyme disease is still very rare in cats and much rarer than in dogs.¬† Irritation or infection at the site of a tick bite is a much more common problem.\n\nWhat to do if your cat has a tick\n\nYou‚Äôre most likely to find a tick on your cat in Spring and Autumn when ticks are most active. But warmer wetter weather with climate change means ticks are a year-round problem. Once a tick attaches, it takes 1-3 days for bacteria to be transferred from the tick to the animal they are feeding on.\n\nCheck your pet at the end of each day. If you find a tick, it‚Äôs best to remove it as soon as possible.\nUse a special tick-removing tool¬† \nGently twist the tick at its base, between the body and the skin\nCheck the whole tick is removed, including the mouthparts, as it‚Äôs important not to leave them inside your cat‚Äôs skin\nDispose of ticks safely, ideally wearing gloves.\nBathe the site of the tick bite with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt to one pint of warm water) or an antiseptic solution such as chlorhexidine (Hibiscrub) for 3-5 days\n\nIf mouth parts are still in your cat‚Äôs skin:\n\nTry to remove the mouthparts with tweezers if you can see them\nContinue to bathe the bite with salt water or antiseptic\nCheck for signs of infection. including redness, swelling, pain or licking\nMouthparts will usually come out eventually\n\nHow cats get ticks\n\nTicks can‚Äôt fly, jump or spin webs. They get onto cats by climbing up blades of grass so they can latch on to them as they brush past. Cats are most likely to pick up ticks if they go outside and city cats are at relatively greater risk.\n\nThe city culprit is the hedgehog tick,¬†Ixodes hexagonus\nThe Hedgehog tick is the most common one found on UK cats\nCats who hunt or explore in woodland, moorland and fields shared with wildlife or grazing animals may pick up the sheep or deer tick,¬†Ixodes ricinus\nCertain areas of the UK are ‚Äòhigher-risk‚Äô areas, including the South West of England, East Anglia, the Scottish Highlands and Islands and Northern England.\n\nYou can find out the risk of ticks in your area by looking up an interactive map created from the¬†Big Tick Study\n\nTicks that are not native to the UK are surviving more easily in our changing climate. Pet travel and imported cats increase the risk of these parasites and diseases they carry entering the UK.\n\nWhen to worry about your cat having ticks\n\nTicks don‚Äôt usually cause disease themselves, but they may carry bacteria and other microbes that do cause dangerous illnesses. Lyme disease is the most serious and common disease transmitted through tick bites in the UK. Around 2.5-5 % of ticks in the UK carry Lyme Disease.\n\nCats who get bitten by infected ticks are very resistant to developing illness from Lyme disease.¬†A very small number of cats may develop more symptoms of more serious illness, including:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nLethargy (tiredness)\nLameness and painful joints in one or more limbs\nEnlarged lymph glands\nLife-threatening kidney disease (although this is very rare)\nSymptoms may develop up to 4 weeks after a tick bite\n\nOther rare diseases which can be spread by ticks include babesiosis, tick-borne fever and ehrlichiosis.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat ticks look like\n\nTicks often look like small lumps or skin tags and it can be hard to tell the difference.\n\nCall a vet if you have found any unexplained lump which grows rapidly\n\nJoii can help with:\n\nIdentifying ticks\nChoosing the best tick preventive treatment for your cat\nHow to remove a tick safely\nWhat to do if the bite looks red or irritated\nRecognising signs and risks of Lyme Disease\n\nTips on how to prevent your cat from getting ticks\n\nThere are treatments readily available to repel and/or kill ticks on pets. However, no treatment is 100% effective. So it‚Äôs essential to check your pet every day for ticks.\n\nTicks will still bite your cat even if you‚Äôve used a preventive treatment. The tick will die within 12-24hours, which is too soon for it to spread disease to your cat.\n\nTick preventive treatments include spot-on treatments, sprays and tablets\nTreatments last between four and twelve weeks.\nThere is also a special collar for cats called ‚ÄúSeresto‚Äù, which lasts for 8 months and is ideal for cats who travel abroad.\nThe ‚Äòbest‚Äô option depends on your cat‚Äôs lifestyle and how easy it is to give them pills.\nSome pets just won‚Äôt take tablets!\n\nNever give dog medication to cats.

Over 30% of all dogs will have ticks on them in the summer months. Dogs of any age or breed can get tick bites. Ticks can spread infectious diseases including Lyme disease.\n\nTicks are the size of tiny seeds when they first latch on to your dog. They stay attached to grow and feed for up to 5 days. Any dog who visits green spaces can get ticks. Ticks can transfer disease by passing infections between animals when they feed on their blood. Lyme disease is the most serious disease spread by ticks in the UK.¬† However, Lyme disease is still very rare in dogs. Irritation or infection at the site of a tick bite is a much more common problem.\n\nWhat to do if your dog has a tick\n\nYou‚Äôre most likely to find a tick on your dog in Spring and Autumn, when ticks are most active. But warmer wetter weather with climate change means ticks are a year-round problem. Once a tick attaches, it takes 1-3 days for bacteria to be transferred from the tick to the animal they are feeding on.\n\nCheck your pet at the end of each day.\nRemove ticks as soon as you find them.\nIt‚Äôs important to remove ticks without leaving the mouthparts inside your pet‚Äôs skin.\nUse a special tick-removing tool. \nCheck the whole tick is removed, including the mouthparts\nDispose of ticks safely, ideally wearing gloves- wrap tightly in tape, flush down the toilet or put in a sealed bag.\nBathe the site of the tick bite with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt to one pint of warm water) or an antiseptic solution such as chlorhexidine (Hibiscrub).\nContinue to bathe for 3-5 days.\n\nIf mouthparts are still in your dog:\n\nTry to remove the mouthparts with tweezers if you can see them.\nContinue to bathe the bite with salt water or antiseptic.\nCheck for signs of infection, including redness, swelling, pain or licking.\nTick mouthparts will usually come out eventually.\n\nThere are treatments available to repel and/or kill ticks on dogs, However, no treatment is 100%. So it‚Äôs essential to check your pet every day for ticks.\n\n¬†\n\n\nHow dogs get ticks\n\nTicks can‚Äôt fly, jump or spin webs. They get onto dogs by climbing up blades of grass so they can latch on to them as they brush past.\n\nDogs are most likely to pick up ticks if they are:\n\nWalking in woodland, moorland, fields and anywhere that green space is shared with wildlife, such as deer, sheep or hedgehogs.\nSpending time in your garden.\nLiving in a ‚Äòhigher-risk‚Äô area, including the South West of England, East Anglia, the Scottish Highlands and Islands and Northern England.\n\nYou can find out the risk of ticks in your area by looking up an interactive map created from the¬†Big Tick Survey\n\nTicks that are not native to the UK are surviving more easily in our changing climate. Pet travel and imported dogs increase the risk of these parasites and diseases they carry entering the UK.\n\nWhen to worry about your dog having ticks\n\nTicks don‚Äôt usually cause disease themselves, but they may carry bacteria and other microbes that do cause dangerous illnesses. Lyme disease is the most serious and common disease transmitted through tick bites in the UK.\n\nAround 2.5-5 % of ticks in the UK carry Lyme Disease\n95% of dogs bitten by infected ticks will not develop any symptoms.\nOf the remaining 5%, most dogs only develop mild symptoms\n\nA very small number of dogs bitten by infected ticks may develop symptoms of more severe illness, including:\n\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nLethargy (tiredness)\nLameness and painful joints in one or more limbs\nEnlarged lymph glands\nLife-threatening kidney disease (although this is very rare)\n\nOther rare diseases which can be spread by ticks include babesiosis, tick-borne fever and ehrlichiosis.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat ticks look like\n\nTicks often look like small lumps or skin tags and it can be hard to tell the difference\n\nCall a vet if you have find any unexplained lump which grows rapidly\n\nJoii can help with\n\nAdvice on tick preventive treatments\nHow to remove a tick safely\nWhat to do if the bite looks red or irritated\nRecognising signs and risks of Lyme Disease\n\nTips on how to prevent your dog from getting ticks\n\nTreatments to repel and/or to kill ticks on pets are readily available. However, no treatment is 100%. So it‚Äôs essential to check your pet every day for ticks.\n\nTicks will still bite your dog even if you‚Äôve used a preventive treatment. The tick will die within 12-24 hours, which is too soon for it to spread disease to your dog.\n\nTick preventive treatments include spot-on treatments, sprays and tablets\nTreatments last between four and twelve weeks.\nThere is also a special collar for dogs called ‚ÄúSeresto‚Äù, which lasts for 8 months and is ideal for dogs who travel abroad.\nThe ‚Äòbest‚Äô option depends on your dog or cat‚Äôs lifestyle and how easy it is to give them pills.\nDogs who swim will be better with tablets.¬†Swimming interferes with surface spot-on treatments and the chemicals they contain can damage water courses.\nSome dogs just won‚Äôt take tablets!\n\nNever give dog medication to cats and vice versa.

Most often it is due to spinal or tail injuries.\n\nIncontinence is when urine is passed without control.¬† Controlling the passage of urine requires a combination of voluntary actions and involuntary reflexes. Voluntary control can be affected by serious damage to any part of the spine. Reflexes can be affected by damage to nerves near the base of the tail. If the bladder is very distended it can lead to overflow and leakage. All of these problems are very serious and a vet check is urgently needed.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is leaking urine\n\nSee a vet straight away if:\n\nan adult cat is leaking urine\nthey appear to be in pain or are not acting normal.\n\nHandle them gently and carefully, as they may be injured.

It is more common in middle-aged neutered females and usually responds well to treatment. Puppies can have a rare and more serious type of incontinence.\n\nThe most common cause is urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence, where the urethra becomes too weak to stop urine from dripping out of the bladder. In puppies, incontinence is often due to a birth defect called ectopic ureter. Urinary incontinence can also be caused by spinal disease or other nerve problems.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence in dogs\nWhy is my dog leaking urine?\n\nUrinary incontinence is when urine leaks out without the dog realising it. This usually happens when they are lying down or resting.\n\nIn puppies with ectopic ureter, the urine coming from the kidneys is deposited beyond the bladder, which prevents normal storage and control.\n\nIn adult dogs the muscles controlling the exit to the bladder weaken over time and the position of the bladder may change.\n\nIn neutered animals, hormonal changes play a significant role in the development of incontinence.\n\nIncontinence from spinal or nerve problems usually happens together with other symptoms, such as pain and trouble moving.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of urinary incontinence in dogs¬†\n\nSpots or puddles of urine on their bed or where they rest\n\nArea around vulva or penis may be wet\n\nPuppies may dribble urine when standing and moving¬†\n\nSymptoms in puppies may not start until they are fully grown\n\n¬†\n\nAre some dogs more at risk of urinary incontinence than others?\n\nThe majority of dogs affected by this condition are neutered females\n\nLarge breeds are more commonly affected, particularly Irish Setters and Boxers\n\nIn puppies, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more commonly affected\n\n¬†\n\nHow is urinary incontinence diagnosed in dogs?\n\nEctopic ureters in puppies can be difficult to diagnose. If size permits, cystoscopy may be ideal. This is when a small tube with a camera is passed through the urethra so the inside can be checked.\n\nOther options include an ultrasound scan, a special type of x-ray or a CT scan.\n\nIn adult dogs, urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence is usually diagnosed by ruling out other causes of incontinence.\n\nA urine test is recommended in all cases to rule out infection and disease in other organs.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat is the treatment for urinary incontinence in dogs?\n\nIn puppies, the abnormal urine path must be closed. In many cases, this can be done during cystoscopy. If not, surgery is required.\n\nIn adult dogs, there are medications to improve bladder control. These tend to work well in females but not so much in males.\n\nSome medications, like phenylpropanolamine (Propalin), directly improve the strength of the muscles around the bladder exit.\n\nOther medications, like estriol (Incurin), replace the effects of oestrogen on the urethral muscle.\n\nThese two types of medications can be used together, and this is thought to have additional benefits.\n\nIf not responding to medication, there are surgical procedures that will reduce urine losses by re-positioning the bladder slightly (colposuspension).\n\nIt is also possible to insert an artificial urethral sphincter to control urine flow or inject material into the urethral wall to increase tension.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to look after a dog with urinary incontinence\n\nUrine can be very irritant to the skin. Until the urine leakage is resolved, it is important to prevent prolonged contact between urine and skin. Simply wiping away any wetness should be enough in most cases.¬†\n\nFor small leaks, incontinence pads or nappies may help manage the problem in the short term. These need to be changed frequently. Look out for any irritation of the skin or vulva and stop using if this develops.\n\nIncreasing the frequency of walks may help, as a fuller bladder is more likely to leak.\n\nFrequent washing of bedding will reduce contamination.\n\nApplying a barrier ointment, like vaseline, to the skin around the vulva or penis may help prevent urine scald.\n\nNever limit water intake as this could cause serious problems!\n\n¬†\n\nTips on how to prevent incontinence in dogs\n\nThere is an association between neutering and incontinence in female dogs.¬†\n\nAn association has also been found with excess body weight.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to worry about your dog with incontinence\n\nCall your vet straight away if your dog is urinating more, straining, or having accidents in the house as there may be a more serious problem.¬†\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYou‚Äôd like to discuss the ideal age for neutering your dog\nYou want to talk about weight control\nYou want to get feeding and diet tips\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Anti-inflammatory painkillers for the first few weeks. Sometimes your cat needs an anaesthetic so the vet can look inside the ear with a camera, take samples, and clean the ear well.\nIdiopathic vestibular syndrome has no specific cure. Symptoms gradually improve, and around 80% of cats will make a good recovery with nursing care.\nThiamine deficiency: Thiamine injections and medicine by mouth.\nDrug toxicity or poisons: cause is withdrawn and supportive treatment provided.\nBrain inflammation: treatment depends on the particular cause but can include antibiotics, antiviral drugs and steroids.\nPolyps: an operation to remove them.\nCancer: treatment options are limited, but may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and specialist surgery.\n\nCancer and brain inflammation cause more severe vestibular disease. Seizures, weakness and generalised illness are more likely. Vets call this central vestibular disease. Specific symptoms depend on the cause or parts of the brain affected. Cats with this form of vestibular disease are less likely to recover.\n\n¬†\n\nCaring for your cat with vestibular disease at home\n\nProtect your cat from injury due to falls or stumbles:\n\nDon‚Äôt let them sleep on your bed or sofa unattended while they‚Äôre still wobbly\nPut a thick, rolled up blanket around them to keep them secure\nKeep litter trays close and easy to get into\n\nHelp with feeding and hydration:\n\nHand feed soft food to avoid choking\nEncourage them to drink and check they stay hydrated (moist pink gums and springy skin)\n\nMassage muscles and move limbs: keep the blood flowing in your cat‚Äôs muscles until they can get around better.\n\nGive prescribed medicine as directed.\n\nStay calm: caring for a cat with vestibular disease can be stressful. But if your cat picks up on your anxiety, it‚Äôll make things worse.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a cat with vestibular disease\n\nMost cats with idiopathic vestibular disease recover completely within a few days. Sometimes recovery takes longer, and your cat may be left with a mild deficit, like a head tilt. If your cat still has a head tilt after 6 months, this is likely to be permanent.\n\nMost cats adapt well over time to mild deficits, but they may need some help with feeding or mobility:\n\nKeep food bowls at ground level and easy to get to if your cat struggles with balance.\nDon‚Äôt let your cat go up or down stairs unsupervised.

Dogs with this form of vestibular disease are less likely to recover.\n\n¬†\n\nCaring for your dog with vestibular disease at home\n\nProtect your dog from injury due to falls or stumbles\n\nRestrict them to a small room or crate\nCover hard edges and corners of furniture with cushions or throws\nDon‚Äôt let them sleep on sofas or beds while they‚Äôre still wobbly\n\nHelp them outside for toileting\n\nTwo or more people for larger dogs\nIt may help to support them with a towel or sheet under their tummy\n\nHelp with feeding: Hand feed food formed into soft balls to reduce risk of choking\n\nMassage muscles and move limbs: Keep the blood flowing in your dog‚Äôs muscles until they can get around better\n\nGive prescribed medicine as directed.\n\n¬†\n\nLiving with a dog with vestibular disease\n\nMost dogs with vestibular disease will gradually recover, but the timescale and degree of recovery vary.\n\nDogs usually recover the majority of normal function within 2-3 days, but some need hospital support for several weeks.\n\nYour dog may recover completely or may be left with a mild deficit, like a head tilt.\n\nIf your dog still has a head tilt after 6 months, this is likely to be permanent.\n\nMost dogs adapt well over time to mild deficits, but they may need some help with feeding or mobility.\n\nProvide raised food bowls if your dog struggles with balance\nDon‚Äôt let your dog go up or down stairs unsupervised. Fitting child safety gates will help with this.\nUse ramps or portable steps to make it easier for your dog getting in and out of the car or getting up steps to the house.\n\nIf your dog has had one episode of idiopathic vestibular disease or ‚Äòold dog syndrome‚Äô, they‚Äôre more likely to have another at some point in the future. This could be any time, from days to years. We can‚Äôt predict if or when it will happen.\n\nA second or subsequent episode may be the same, more severe or less severe. Again, we can‚Äôt predict in advance.\n\nMiddle ear infections need prolonged courses of antibiotic treatment over several months.\n\nPersevere with giving prescription medicines for the full duration\nLong courses of antibiotic treatment will be costly, especially for larger dogs.\n\n¬†\n\nQuality of life and when to say goodbye\n\nSadly, about 20% of the dogs who get vestibular disease don‚Äôt recover. And some who recover well from a first episode may suffer more severely from a second or subsequent one.\n\nWhen this happens, you may worry about your companion‚Äôs quality of life. You wonder if it‚Äôs fair to carry on with treatment or whether the time has come to think about euthanasia\n\nDeciding when to say goodbye is a decision that‚Äôs very hard to make and distressing for everyone involved. The best any of us can do is focus on what‚Äôs best for our beloved companion. We can start by thinking about their quality of life. Do good things outweigh the bad?\n\nDo they still enjoy things and take an interest in life?\n\nAre other illnesses well-controlled?\n\nAre the symptoms of pain or anxiety controlled?\n\nAre you and they exhausted?\n\nAssess quality of life\n\n¬†\n\nTips to prevent vestibular disease in dogs\n\nIdiopathic vestibular syndrome: we don‚Äôt know the cause of ‚Äòold dog syndrome‚Äô so we can‚Äôt prevent it.\n\nMiddle and Inner ear disease: treat external ear infections (otitis externa) promptly to reduce the risk of spread to the middle ear\n\nInfectious diseases: keep your dog‚Äôs vaccinations up-to-date\n\nToxin exposure: Keep potentially-hazardous chemicals out of sight and reach of your dog\n\nWhen to worry about vestibular disease in your dog\n\nSeek a vet in practice immediately if your dog suddenly develops balance problems after:\n\nSuffering a blow to their head\nStarting a new medicine\nBeing exposed to possible toxins (human drugs, household chemicals, poisons)\nShowing signs of pain and a high temperature (hot to touch, panting, lethargic)\n\nCall and speak to a vet if your dog suddenly loses balance or can‚Äôt stand properly.\n\nWhile most dogs will recover enough to manage daily life, not all do. And for those who seem to recover, a repeated episode may be much more severe and have a poorer outcome.\n\nThe outlook is poorer if your dog:\n\nIs unable to stand with support after a week and unaided after three weeks\nIs unable to toilet independently and is too heavy to be supported to do so regularly\n\nCancer and brain infections cause more severe vestibular disease and have additional symptoms. These have a more guarded outlook.\n\nVestibular disease is more worrying if accompanied by:\n\nMuscle weakness as well as balance problems\nSeizures\nBlindness\nDragging or knuckling feet\n\nJoii can help with\n\nRecognising symptoms of vestibular disease\nCaring for a dog with balance problems\nTalking through your concerns about quality of life\n 1\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

In most cases, they get better on their own or with supportive management.\n\nWhen cats eat grass, bugs, or their own fur, they can be sick afterward. This is not normally a reason for concern, and they can be cared for at home. Sometimes they may have diarrhoea too. We call this gastroenteritis. It‚Äôs important that vomiting cats stay hydrated and maintain stable blood sugar levels.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat to do if your cat is vomiting\nDo not feed them for a period of 2-4 hours\nAllow access to water, little and often\nFeed a teaspoon of a bland diet, such as plain boiled chicken or white fish, every 2 hours.\n\nIf you find that your cat can‚Äôt keep water or food down, please speak to a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nWhy your cat is being sick\nCommon causes of vomiting in cats\nDiet: eating something they shouldn‚Äôt have (plants, insects, small lizards), sudden change in food or eating too much, too quickly\nBlockages in the stomach or in the gut: foreign bodies like parts of toys, hairballs, worms, or a mass (growth/tumour)\nFood intolerances or allergies:¬†when cats react to ingredients in their normal food causing vomiting, diarrhoea, and skin problems\nIllnesses¬†in other organs (liver, kidney or pancreas)\nToxins, poisons or reactions to medications: like human painkillers, certain antibiotics, wormers and vitamins, garden and house plants, antifreeze, or insecticides\nInfections:¬†virus or bacteria\n\nFind out more about other causes of vomiting in cats.\n\n¬†\n\nWhen to be worried about your cat being sick\n\nCats are small and can get dehydrated or develop low blood sugars quickly.

Please take your cat to see a vet as soon as possible.\nCat sick, undigested food.\nCat sick, white foam.\nCat sick, bile with blood. Your cat should be seen by a vet.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to treat a vomiting cat at home\nHome remedies for cats who are being sick\n\nIf your cat has been sick a couple of times but is otherwise bright and well, it‚Äôs important to:\n\nNot let them eat for 2-3 hours after vomiting. Let their stomach rest and recover.\nAllow access to fresh water\nEncourage them to drink and stay hydrated:\nOffer rehydration solutions especially made for animals\nor the water from a tin of tuna in spring water\nIf they don‚Äôt vomit again, feed a teaspoon of bland, low-fat food every 2-3 hours for the first 24 hours. Then increase the amount and reduce the frequency for the next 2-3 days.

These are more common in older cats but can happen at any age. In cats, more than 50% of skin tumours are cancerous, so a vet check is always recommended.\n\nThere are different types of skin growths that can look like warts in cats. Like with many other species, a common cause is a papillomavirus. Sadly, in cats, the body doesn‚Äôt often clear the growth, and in many cases, it will become cancerous over time. Early treatment is more likely to work, and surgery is the best option currently available.\n\n\nWhere do warts on cats come from?¬†\n\nWarts can be caused by a virus or by skin cells growing abnormally. Cats can also get many different types of skin growths. These can come from normal skin cells growing out of control and losing their normal function. They should always be checked by a vet.\n\n\n¬†What do warts look like?\n\nWarts on the skin can look like:\n\nExtra skin growing out¬†\nAn irregular disk on the skin¬†\nA crusty bit of skin¬†\n\nOther symptoms can be associated with the wart:\n\nRedness of the nearby skin\nItching or tenderness\nDischarge\nWeight loss\nLethargy\n\nCats at higher risk of developing warts\n\nWhite or hairless cats are at higher risk for skin tumours, especially if they spend a lot of time in the sun. This is especially true for cancerous tumours.\n\nCan I catch or pass warts to my cat?\n\nDespite many species having warts caused by papillomavirus, each virus will usually only cause them in a specific species. A papillomavirus from a cat cannot grow on human skin, and vice-versa. They can be contagious to other cats but this doesn‚Äôt happen often.\n\n\nDiagnosis of skin warts in cats\n\nYou can‚Äôt tell what a skin lump is just from how it looks, but irregular, irritated and fast-growing lumps are more concerning\n\nScratching a small sample from a lump using a needle, called a fine needle aspirate, is often useful. However, it may provide limited information and does not work at all for some lumps\n\nA final diagnosis requires a biopsy. This is where a part, or all, of the lump is removed during surgery and sent to the lab for analysis¬†\n\nOther tests (x-rays, ultrasound, and immunofluorescence) may be needed if cancer is suspected.\n\n\nTreatment of warts¬†\n\nSurgery may be the only treatment needed if the lump is not cancerous or is caught early\n\nOther treatment options (Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy) depend on the exact type of tumour present.¬†\n\nIf the wart looks sore, gentle cleaning and a mild antiseptic may help prevent infection while you wait to see the vet.\n\n\nCan I treat my cat‚Äôs wart at home?\n\nAs previously mentioned, many warts and skin growths in cats will be cancerous. You should not delay veterinary treatment. Trying to remove these at home may cause your cat unnecessary suffering, infection or even help the tumour spread.\n\n\nWhen to worry about a wart on your cat\n\nAlways have skin growths on your cat checked by a vet, most likely, they will need to be tested.¬†\n\nSeek help from a vet if your cat has a wart that:\n\nhas grown very quickly\nIs bleeding\nIs painful\n\nJoii can help if:\n\nYou found a lump on your cat‚Äôs skin and want to have it checked\nYou are worried about your cat‚Äôs warts and want to discuss options\nYour cat‚Äôs wart is causing your cat to be mildly uncomfortable\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

There are two types of warts that commonly appear in dogs, one that affects puppies and another more common in older dogs.¬†\n\nSkin tags or lumps that look like warts are usually caused by a Papillomavirus. Puppies will develop small cauliflower-like growths on their lips or gums, often in small groups. Older dogs develop small tags on their skin anywhere in their body. In both cases, the growths tend to be small and usually disappear after several weeks. There are other types of skin growths that can look like warts, especially on the eyelids.¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†What causes warts in dogs\n\nThere are many types of papillomavirus and they are very common. If skin defences are disrupted, a dog papillomavirus can break in and infect skin cells. This causes these cells to grow abnormally and results in a wart\n\nPuppies tend to get warts on their gums. Their immature defences allow the virus to settle in without a previous injury. The virus causing these is the same\n\nSome skin tumours can initially look like warts, but these can be a lot more serious.\n\nSymptoms of warts in dogs\n\nThe most obvious symptom is obviously the wart itself, but sometimes you can also see:\n\nRedness\nSwelling\nItching\nBleeding\nDischarge\n\nThese symptoms should be discussed with a vet as they may point to a more serious problem or complication.\n\nDogs at higher risk of developing warts\n\nPuppies tend to have bigger warts and are much more likely to have multiple warts.\n\nDogs with a weak immune system, due to disease or treatment for other conditions.\n\nDogs that have previously had skin cancer are at higher risk of something more serious.\n\nCan I catch warts from my dog? How about my other pets?\n\nHumans cannot catch warts from dogs. The dog papillomavirus can only affect dogs, so cats and other furries are also safe. It can spread between dogs, but only causes warts if the skin is damaged. No extra precautions are usually recommended to prevent spread.\n\nHow to know if a dog‚Äôs wart is serious\n\nYour vet may suspect a Papilloma-type wart after visual examination and recommend monitoring\n\nIf the diagnosis isn‚Äôt clear, especially if there is inflammation or discomfort, your vet may try to take a¬† sample with a needle to examine under the microscope. This is called a Fine Needle Aspirate or FNA.\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt enough, a biopsy may be required.\n\nHow to treat warts in dogs\n\nMouth warts in puppies will disappear after 4-8 weeks. If there are a lot of them, or they are large, they can cause issues with eating or get infected. Such cases may need treatment with antibiotics or anti-inflammatories. Very severe cases may need to be treated with a specially-prepared vaccine.\n\nSkin warts on older dogs will often disappear as well. If the wart is getting traumatised or if there are any concerns, it can be removed surgically.\n\nCryosurgery uses extremely cold liquid to freeze a lump in place and then remove it with minimal bleeding. This is an option in some practices but requires special equipment and knowledge.¬†\n\nRemoval of warts should always be done professionally. Using unlicensed ointments or procedures at home can damage the skin and cause serious complications.\n\nWhat should I do about my dog‚Äôs warts?\n\nAny growths or lumps should be examined by a vet. If your vet recommends monitoring, it may help if you measure a lump every 1-2 weeks and check it every couple of days.\n\nTrying to remove warts at home may cause unnecessary suffering, infection or even help them spread.\n\nWhen to worry about a wart on my dog\n\nA vet check may be urgent¬† if:\n\nThe wart becomes red and inflamed\nThere is swelling or discharge\nThe area becomes painful or itchy\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",

Most cats will pick up worms at some point in their lives, but untreated cats, kittens and cats who hunt are most at risk.\n\nDifferent types of worms live in different parts of the body. They cause health problems which range from mild to life-threatening and the illnesses they cause depend on their location. You can protect your cat against the risk of worms with regular preventive treatment using an effective wormer. Different wormers may be required for different types of worms.\n\n¬†\n\nHow do I know if my cat has worms?\n\nTwo types of worms are most common in cats ‚Äì roundworms and tapeworms. Lungworms, hookworms and whipworms also occur in the UK, but are uncommon in cats.\n\n¬†\n\nRoundworms and tapeworms\n\nThey live in your cat‚Äôs intestines. They might not cause any symptoms at all, so you don‚Äôt always know if your cat has worms.\n\nRoundworms can grow up to 15 cm long in cats. And even small types of tapeworms reach 50cm.\n\nTapeworms are like long ribbons made up of lots of tiny individual segments. Each segment contains between 30.000 and 1.000.000 eggs. They break off from the adult worm and pass out through your cat‚Äôs bottom in poo.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of worms in cats\n\nEvidence your cat has intestinal worms includes:\n\nExcessive grooming under their tail, possibly causing hair loss.\nSpaghetti-like roundworms in poo or vomit\nSmall white things in poo that look like grains of rice are tapeworm segments\nTapeworm segments may also be stuck in the hair around your cat‚Äôs bottom and tail\n\n¬†\n\nIntestinal worms\n\nIntestinal worms steal your cat‚Äôs food and stop them gaining or maintaining weight. But they rarely cause severe illness, except in young kittens. Symptoms of worms relate to tummy upsets or poor nutrition.\n\nPoor body condition and weight loss\nA dull staring coat\nDeveloping a ‚Äòpot belly‚Äô\nDiarrhoea and vomiting, which can be severe in kittens and untreated cats and may contain blood.\nA cough caused by migrating immature worms.

Around 34% of dogs in the UK have worms. Most dogs will pick up worms at some point in their lives, but puppies, adult dogs who eat things outside and untreated dogs are most at risk.\n\nDifferent types of worms live in different parts of the body. They cause health problems which range from mild to life-threatening and the illnesses they cause depend on their location. You can protect your dog against the risk of worms with regular preventive treatment using an effective wormer. Different wormers may be required for different worms.\n\n¬†\n\nHow to know if your dog has worms\n\nTwo types of worms are most common in dogs ‚Äì Intestinal worms and lungworms.\n\nIntestinal worms include roundworms and tapeworms.\n\n¬†\n\nRoundworms and tapeworms\n\nThey usually live in your dog‚Äôs intestines. They may not cause any symptoms at all, so you don‚Äôt always know if your dog has worms.\n\nBe prepared! Roundworms can grow up to 15 cm long in dogs. And even small types of tapeworms reach 50cm.\n\nTapeworms are like long ribbons made up of lots of tiny individual segments. Each segment contains between 30.000 and 1.000.000 eggs. Segments break off the adult tapeworm and pass out through your dog‚Äôs bottom in poo.\n\n¬†\n\nSymptoms of worms in dogs\nIntestinal worms in adult dogs\n\nEvidence your dog has intestinal worms includes:\n\nScooting or chewing under their tail\nSpaghetti-like roundworms in poo\nSmall white things in poo that look like grains of rice are tapeworm segments\nTapeworm segments may also be in the hair around your dog‚Äôs bottom and tail\n\nIntestinal worms consume your dog‚Äôs food and stop them gaining or maintaining weight. But they rarely cause severe illness, except in young puppies.\n\nSymptoms of worms are usually due to tummy upset or poor nutrition. For example:\n\nPoor body condition and weight loss\nA dull staring coat\nDeveloping a ‚Äòpot belly‚Äô\nDiarrhoea and vomiting, which can be severe in puppies and untreated dogs\n\n¬†\n\nIntestinal worms in puppies\nPuppies with a lot of worms may develop breathing problems and pneumonia due to worm larvae in their lungs\nAdult worms can completely block a small puppy‚Äôs intestine, causing life-threatening illness\n\n¬†\n\nLungworms\n\nLive inside your dog‚Äôs airways or in the blood vessels of their lungs and heart. You won‚Äôt see evidence of these worms in your dog‚Äôs poo.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nChronic coughs lasting weeks to months\nWeakness and low energy\nBreathing difficulty and pneumonia\n\nAngiostrongylus is the most common lungworm in the UK.\n\nOther lungworms are very rare in the uk but include:\n\nOslerus osleri\n\nLives in the windpipe (trachea) and larger airways\nTransmitted from bitches to pups in saliva during grooming\nUsually found in dogs under 2 years old\n\nCrenosoma vulpis (Fox Lungworm)\n\nLives in windpipe and airways\nInfection from eating slugs or snails or a creature which has eaten these\n\n¬†\n\nHow do dogs get worms?\nIntestinal worms\nEating soil contaminated with worm eggs from poo.\nGrooming ‚Äì licking up and swallowing unseen worm eggs on their coat\nEating dead wildlife, like rodents or rabbits\nScavenging\nFrom an infected mum even before birth\nFrom infected mum‚Äôs milk\n\nImportant!\n\nWhen dogs eat roundworm eggs, the larvae hatch out and burrow out through intestine walls into tissues and blood vessels.\nLarvae can migrate through the body into tissues like the heart, liver, eyes and lungs.\nIn adult dogs over 6 months old, their immune system stops the worms at this stage, and the halted larvae form cysts in tissues.\n\nIn puppies, pregnant bitches and dogs with weakened immune systems\n\nMaturing larvae in the lungs are coughed up and swallowed, then re-enter the intestine as adult worms\n\n¬†\n\nTapeworms\nEating fleas that have eaten tapeworm eggs.\nEating dead wildlife, like rodents or rabbits\n\nWorm eggs passed in poo can remain in soil for years and still be present long after the poo itself has gone. Dogs walking on contaminated soil get the eggs on their feet and fur and accidentally eat them when they groom themselves. For this reason, it‚Äôs essential that owners always clean up after their dogs.\n\n¬†\n\nLungworm\n\nLungworm larvae from infected dogs or foxes are consumed by slugs and snails.\n\nDogs then get infected by:\n\nEating slugs or snails infected with Angiostrongylus larvae\nLicking slime trails\nEating food or eating from bowls which are contaminated with snail slime\nPlaying with toys which have been left outside\n\n¬†\n\nIs my family at risk of getting worms?\n\nHumans can get infected with roundworms from dogs. Around 5% of adults in the UK have antibodies to the dog roundworm, toxocara canis. This means that they have been exposed to the infection at some time in their lives.\n\nSymptoms of illness are very rare but are caused by migrating larvae.

The risk of a dog encountering a lungworm host is therefore high.\nOnly snails and slugs carry infectious late-stage larvae. When a dog (or fox) eats a snail or slug (either on purpose or accidentally), the larvae migrate from the intestines through the liver and into the bloodstream. They then reach the heart, where they mature into adults. There they breed, and their eggs hatch into larvae which enter the airways. From the lungs, the larvae are coughed up, swallowed, and pass out of the body in poo. There they can infect passing slugs and snails.\n\nSlime trails can also contain larvae, making anything the snail or slug has crawled over a risk. This includes bowls, toys and grass, which a dog may eat. Young dogs may be more at risk, purely because they may be more curious.\n\nAlthough a dog can‚Äôt catch lungworm directly from another dog or fox, an infected fox (or dog) in the area can infect local snails and slugs, thus increasing the risk for everyone in the locality.\n\nCall a vet ‚Äî ¬£28",
